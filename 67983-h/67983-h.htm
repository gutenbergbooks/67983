<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> It was a dull affair.</p>
<p class='line0'>One of those comedies in which you see,</p>
<p class='line0'>As Lopè says, the history of the world</p>
<p class='line0'>Brought down from Genesis to the day of judgment.</p>
<p class='line0'>There were three duels in the first tornada,</p>
<p class='line0'>Three gentlemen receiving deadly wounds,</p>
<p class='line0'>Laying their hands upon their hearts and saying</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>O I am dead!</span> A lover in a closet,</p>
<p class='line0'>An old hidalgo, and a gay Don Juan,</p>
<p class='line0'>A Doña Inez with a black mantilla</p>
<p class='line0'>Followed at twilight by an unknown lover,</p>
<p class='line0'>Who looks intently where he knows she is not!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Don Carlos.</span> Of course the Preciosa danced to-night?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> And ne’er danced better. Every footstep fell</p>
<p class='line0'>As lightly as a sunbeam on the water.</p>
<p class='line0'>I think the girl extremely beautiful.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Don Carlos.</span> Almost beyond the privilege of woman!</p>
<p class='line0'>I saw her in the Prado yesterday.</p>
<p class='line0'>Her step was royal—queen-like—and her face</p>
<p class='line0'>As beauteous as a saint’s in Paradise.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> May not a saint fall from her Paradise,</p>
<p class='line0'>And be no more a saint?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Don Carlos.</span> Why do you ask?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> Because ’tis whispered that this angel fell;</p>
<p class='line0'>And though she is a virgin outwardly,</p>
<p class='line0'>Within she is a sinner; like those panels</p>
<p class='line0'>Or doors and altar-pieces, the old monks</p>
<p class='line0'>Painted in convents, with the Virgin Mary</p>
<p class='line0'>On the outside, and on the inside Venus!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Don Carlos.</span> Nay, nay! you do her wrong.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> Ah! say you so?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Don Carlos.</span> She is as virtuous as she is fair;</p>
<p class='line0'>A very modest girl, and still a maid.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> You are too credulous. Would you persuade me</p>
<p class='line0'>That a mere dancing girl, who shows herself</p>
<p class='line0'>Nightly, half-naked, on the stage for money,</p>
<p class='line0'>And with voluptuous motions fires the blood</p>
<p class='line0'>Of inconsiderate youth, is to be held</p>
<p class='line0'>A model for her virtue?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Don Carlos.</span> You forget</p>
<p class='line0'>That she’s a gipsy girl.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> And therefore won</p>
<p class='line0'>The easier.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Don Carlos.</span> Nay, not to be won at all!</p>
<p class='line0'>The only virtue that a gipsy prizes</p>
<p class='line0'>Is chastity. That is her only virtue.</p>
<p class='line0'>Dearer than life she holds it. I remember</p>
<p class='line0'>A gipsy woman, a vile, shameless bawd,</p>
<p class='line0'>Whose craft was to betray the young and fair;</p>
<p class='line0'>And yet this woman was above all bribes.</p>
<p class='line0'>And when a noble lord, touched by her beauty,</p>
<p class='line0'>The wild and wizard beauty of her race,</p>
<p class='line0'>Offered her gold to be what she made others,</p>
<p class='line0'>She turned upon him, with a look of scorn,</p>
<p class='line0'>And smote him in the face!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> Most virtuous gipsy!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Don Carlos.</span> Nay, do not mock me. I would fain believe</p>
<p class='line0'>That woman, in her deepest degradation,</p>
<p class='line0'>Holds something sacred, something undefiled,</p>
<p class='line0'>Some pledge and keepsake of her higher nature,</p>
<p class='line0'>And, like the diamond in the dark, retains</p>
<p class='line0'>Some quenchless gleam of the celestial light!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> Yet Preciosa would have taken the gold.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Don Carlos.</span> (<span class='it'>rising.</span>) You will not be persuaded!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> Yes; persuade me.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Don Carlos.</span> No one so deaf as he who will not hear!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> No one so blind as he who will not see!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Don Carlos.</span> And so good night. I wish you pleasant dreams,</p>
<p class='line0'>And greater faith in woman.— &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<span class='it'>Exit.</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> Greater faith!</p>

<p class='line0'>Victorian is her lover?</p>

<p class='line0'>She sends your jewels back, and bids me tell you</p>
<p class='line0'>She is not to be purchased by your gold.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> Then I will try some other way to win her.</p>
<p class='line0'>Pray dost thou know Victorian?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Fran.</span> Yes, my lord;</p>
<p class='line0'>I saw him at the jeweller’s to-day.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> What was he doing there?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Fran.</span> I saw him buy</p>
<p class='line0'>A golden ring, that had a ruby in it.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> Was there another like it?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Fran.</span> One so like it</p>
<p class='line0'>I could not choose between them.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Lara.</span> It is well.</p>

instruments.</span></p>

</div>

<div class='dramastart'><!----></div>

<p class='speech-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Chispa.</span> Abernuncio Satanas! and a plague on all lovers
who ramble about at night, drinking the elements instead of
sleeping quietly in their beds. Every dead man to his
cemetery, say I; and every friar to his monastery. Now,
here’s my master, Victorian, yesterday a cow-keeper and
to-day a gentleman; yesterday a student and to-day a lover;
and I must be up later than the nightingale, for as the abbot
sings so must the sacristan respond. God grant he may soon
be married, for then shall all this serenading cease. Man
is fire, and woman is tow, and the devil comes and blows;
and, therefore, I have heard my grandmother say, that if
your neighbor has a son, wipe his nose and marry him to
your daughter. Aye! marry! marry! marry! Mother,
what does marry mean? It means to spin, to bear children,
and to weep, my daughter! And of a truth there is something
more in matrimony than cake and kid gloves. (<span class='it'>To the
musicians.</span>) And now, gentlemen, Pax vobiscum! as the
ass said to the cabbages. Pray walk this way; and don’t
hang down your heads. It is no disgrace to have an old
father and a ragged shirt. Now, look you, you are gentlemen
who lead the life of crickets; you enjoy hunger by day
and noise by night. Yet, I beseech you, for this once be
not loud, but pathetic; for it is a serenade to a damsel in
bed, and not to the man in the moon. Your object is not
to arouse and terrify, but to soothe and bring lulling dreams.
Therefore, each shall not play upon his instrument as if it
were the only one in the universe, but gently, and with a
certain modesty, according with the others. Pray, how
may I call thy name, friend?</p>

<p class='speech-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>First Musician.</span> Geronimo Gil, at your service.</p>

<p class='speech-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Chispa.</span> Every tub smells of the wine that is in it. Pray,
Geronimo, is not Saturday an unpleasant day with thee?</p>

<p class='speech-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>First M.</span> Why so?</p>

<p class='speech-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Chispa.</span> Because I have heard it said that Saturday is an
unpleasant day for those who have but one shirt. Moreover,
I have seen thee at the tavern, and if thou canst run as fast
as thou canst drink, I should like to hunt hares with thee.
What instrument is that?</p>

<p class='speech-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>First M.</span> An Aragonese bag-pipe.</p>

<p class='speech-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Chispa.</span> Pray, art thou related to the bag-piper of Bujalance,
who asked a maravedi for playing and ten for leaving
off?</p>

<p class='speech-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>First M.</span> No, your honor.</p>

<p class='speech-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Chispa.</span> I am glad of it. What other instruments have
we?</p>

<p class='speech-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Second and Third M.</span> We play the bandurria.</p>

<p class='speech-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Chispa.</span> A pleasing instrument. And thou?</p>

<p class='speech-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Fourth M.</span> The fife.</p>

<p class='speech-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Chispa.</span> I like it; it has a cheerful, soul-stirring sound,
that soars up to my lady’s window like the song of a swallow.
And you others?</p>

<p class='speech-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Other Musicians.</span> We are the singers, please your honor.</p>

<p class='speech-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Chispa.</span> You are too many. Do you think we are going
to sing mass in the Cathedral of Cordova? Four men can
make but little use of one shoe, and I see not how you can
all sing in one song. But follow me along the garden wall.
That is the way my master climbs to the lady’s window.
It is by the vicar’s skirts that the devil climbs into the belfry.
Come, follow me and make no noise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<span class='it'>Exeunt.</span></p>

<p class='line0'>Under the orange-trees, beside a fountain.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> ’Twas Easter-Sunday. The full-blossomed trees</p>
<p class='line0'>Filled all the air with fragrance and with joy.</p>
<p class='line0'>The priests were singing, and the organ sounded,</p>
<p class='line0'>And then anon the great Cathedral bell.</p>
<p class='line0'>It was the elevation of the Host.</p>
<p class='line0'>We both of us fell down upon our knees,</p>
<p class='line0'>Under the orange boughs, and prayed together.</p>
<p class='line0'>I never had been happy, till that moment.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> Thou blessed angel!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> And when thou wast gone</p>
<p class='line0'>I felt an aching here. I did not speak</p>
<p class='line0'>To any one that day.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> Sweet Preciosa!</p>
<p class='line0'>I lov’d thee even then, though I was silent!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> I thought I ne’er should see thy face again.</p>
<p class='line0'>Thy farewell had to me a sound of sorrow.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> That was the first sound in the song of love!</p>
<p class='line0'>Scarce more than silence is, and yet a sound.</p>
<p class='line0'>Hands of invisible spirits touch the strings</p>
<p class='line0'>Of that mysterious instrument, the soul,</p>
<p class='line0'>And play the prelude of our fate. We hear</p>
<p class='line0'>The voice prophetic, and are not alone.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> That is my faith. Dost thou believe these warnings?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> So far as this. Our feelings and our thoughts</p>
<p class='line0'>Tend ever on, and rest not in the Present.</p>
<p class='line0'>As drops of rain fall into some dark well,</p>
<p class='line0'>And from below comes a scarce audible sound⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>So fall our thoughts into the dark Hereafter,</p>
<p class='line0'>And their mysterious echo reaches us.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> I’ve felt it so, but found no words to say it!</p>
<p class='line0'>I cannot reason—I can only feel!</p>
<p class='line0'>But thou hast language for all thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p class='line0'>Thou art a scholar: and sometimes I think</p>
<p class='line0'>We cannot walk together in this world!</p>
<p class='line0'>The distance that divides us is too great!</p>
<p class='line0'>Henceforth thy pathway lies among the stars;</p>
<p class='line0'>I must not hold thee back.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> Thou little skeptic!</p>
<p class='line0'>Dost thou still doubt?—What I most prize in woman</p>
<p class='line0'>Is her affection, not her intellect!</p>
<p class='line0'>Compare me with the great men of the earth⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>What am I? Why, a pigmy among giants!</p>
<p class='line0'>But if thou lovest—mark me! I say lovest⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>The greatest of thy sex excels thee not!</p>
<p class='line0'>The world of the affections is thy world⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Not that of man’s ambition. In that stillness</p>
<p class='line0'>Which most becomes a woman, calm and holy,</p>
<p class='line0'>Thou sittest by the fireside of the heart,</p>
<p class='line0'>Feeding its flame. The element of fire</p>
<p class='line0'>Is pure. It cannot change nor hide its nature,</p>
<p class='line0'>But burns as brightly in a gipsy camp</p>
<p class='line0'>As in a palace hall. Art thou convinced?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> Aye, that I love thee, as the good love heaven,</p>
<p class='line0'>But that I am not worthy of that heaven.</p>
<p class='line0'>How shall I more deserve it?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> Loving more.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> I cannot love thee more; my heart is full.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> Then let it overflow, and I will drink it,</p>
<p class='line0'>As in the summer-time the thirsty sands</p>
<p class='line0'>Drink the swift waters of a mountain torrent,</p>
<p class='line0'>And still do thirst for more. (<span class='it'>Kisses her.</span>)</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>A Watchman in the street.</span> Ave Maria</p>
<p class='line0'>Purissima! ’Tis midnight and serene!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> Hear’st thou that cry?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> It is a hateful sound,</p>
<p class='line0'>To scare thee from me!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> As the hunter’s horn</p>
<p class='line0'>Doth scare the timid stag, or bark of hounds</p>
<p class='line0'>The moor-fowl from his mate.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> Pray do not go!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> I must away to Alcalá to-night.</p>
<p class='line0'>Think of me when I am away.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> Fear not!</p>
<p class='line0'>I have no thoughts that do not think of thee.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> (<span class='it'>giving her a ring.</span>) And to remind thee of my love, take this.</p>
<p class='line0'>A serpent emblem of Eternity,</p>
<p class='line0'>A ruby,—say, a drop of my heart’s blood.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> It is an ancient saying, that the ruby</p>
<p class='line0'>Brings gladness to the wearer, and preserves</p>
<p class='line0'>The heart pure, and, if laid beneath the pillow,</p>
<p class='line0'>Drives away evil dreams. But then, alas!</p>
<p class='line0'>It was a serpent tempted Eve to sin.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> What convent of barefooted Carmelites</p>
<p class='line0'>Taught thee so much theology?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> (<span class='it'>laying her hand upon his mouth.</span>) Hush! hush!</p>
<p class='line0'>Good night! and may all holy angels guard thee!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> Good night! good night! Thou art my guardian angel!</p>
<p class='line0'>I have no other saint than thee to pray to!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;(<span class='it'>He descends by the balcony.</span>)</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> Take care, and do not hurt thee. Art thou safe?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> (<span class='it'>from the garden.</span>) Safe as my love for thee! But art thou safe?</p>
<p class='line0'>Others can climb a balcony by moonlight</p>
<p class='line0'>As well as I. Pray, shut thy window close;</p>
<p class='line0'>I’m jealous of the perfumed air of night</p>
<p class='line0'>That from this garden climbs to kiss thy lips.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> (<span class='it'>throwing down her handkerchief.</span>) Thou silly child!</p>
<p class='line0'>Take this to blind thine eyes.</p>
<p class='line0'>It is my benison!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> And brings to me</p>
<p class='line0'>Sweet fragrance from thy lips, as the soft wind</p>
<p class='line0'>Wafts to the out-bound mariner the breath</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the beloved land he leaves behind.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> Make not thy voyage long.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> To-morrow night</p>
<p class='line0'>Shall see me safe returned. Thou art the star</p>
<p class='line0'>To guide me to an anchorage. Good night!</p>
<p class='line0'>My beauteous star! My star of love, good night!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Pre.</span> Good night!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Watchman.</span> (<span class='it'>at a distance.</span>) Ave Maria Purissima!</p>

<p class='line0'>Is like a scene in the old play—the curtain</p>
<p class='line0'>Rises to solemn music, and, lo! enter</p>
<p class='line0'>The eleven thousand Virgins of Cologne!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> Nay, like the Sibyl’s volumes, thou shouldst say;</p>
<p class='line0'>Those that remained, after the six were burned,</p>
<p class='line0'>Being held as precious as the nine together.</p>
<p class='line0'>But listen to my tale. Dost thou remember</p>
<p class='line0'>The gipsy girl we saw at Cordova</p>
<p class='line0'>Dance the Romalis in the market-place?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Hyp.</span> Thou meanest Preciosa.</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> I was; and, to be frank with thee, I am!</p>
<p class='line0'>She’s in Madrid. O pardon me, my friend,</p>
<p class='line0'>If I so long have kept this secret from thee;</p>
<p class='line0'>But silence is the charm that guards such treasures,</p>
<p class='line0'>And if a word be spoken ere the time,</p>
<p class='line0'>They sink again, they were not meant for us.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Hyp.</span> Alas! alas! I see thou art in love.</p>
<p class='line0'>How speeds thy wooing? Is the maiden coy?</p>
<p class='line0'>Write her a song, beginning with an Ave;</p>

<p class='line0'>What, ho! The Primus of great Alcalá</p>
<p class='line0'>Enamor’d of a gipsy? Tell me frankly,</p>
<p class='line0'>How meanest thou?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> I mean it honestly.</p>
<p class='line0'>The angels sang in heaven when she was born!</p>
<p class='line0'>She is a precious jewel I have found</p>
<p class='line0'>Among the filth and rubbish of the world.</p>
<p class='line0'>I’ll stoop for it; but when I wear it here,</p>
<p class='line0'>Set on my forehead like the morning star,</p>
<p class='line0'>The world may wonder, but it will not laugh.</p>

<p class='line0'>With thy unseasonable jests! Pray, tell me,</p>
<p class='line0'>Is there no virtue in the world?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Hyp.</span> Not much.</p>
<p class='line0'>What, think’st thou, is she doing at this moment⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Now, while we speak of her?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> She lies asleep,</p>
<p class='line0'>And, from her parted lips, her gentle breath</p>
<p class='line0'>Comes like the fragrance from the lips of flowers.</p>
<p class='line0'>Her delicate limbs are still, and on her breast</p>
<p class='line0'>The cross she pray’d to, e’er she fell asleep,</p>
<p class='line0'>Rises and falls with the soft tide of dreams,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like a light barge safe moor’d.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Hyp.</span> Which means, in prose,</p>
<p class='line0'>She’s sleeping with her mouth a little open!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> O would I had the old magician’s glass</p>
<p class='line0'>To see her as she lies in child-like sleep!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Hyp.</span> And would’st thou venture?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> Aye, indeed I would!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Hyp.</span> Thou art courageous. Hast thou e’er reflected</p>
<p class='line0'>How much lies hidden in that one word <span class='it'>now</span>?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> Yes; all the awful mystery of Life!</p>
<p class='line0'>I oft have thought, my dear Hypolito,</p>
<p class='line0'>That could we, by some spell of magic, change</p>
<p class='line0'>The world and its inhabitants to stone,</p>
<p class='line0'>In the same attitudes they now are in,</p>
<p class='line0'>What fearful glances downward might we cast</p>
<p class='line0'>Into the hollow chasms of human life!</p>
<p class='line0'>What groups should we behold about the death-bed,</p>
<p class='line0'>Putting to shame the group of Niobe!</p>
<p class='line0'>What joyful welcomes, and what sad farewells!</p>
<p class='line0'>What stony tears in those congealed eyes!</p>
<p class='line0'>What visible joy or anguish in those cheeks!</p>
<p class='line0'>What bridal pomps, and what funereal shows!</p>
<p class='line0'>What foes, like gladiators, fierce and struggling!</p>
<p class='line0'>What lovers with their marble lips together!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Hyp.</span> Aye, there it is! and if I were in love</p>
<p class='line0'>That is the very point I most should dread.</p>
<p class='line0'>This magic glass, these magic spells of thine</p>
<p class='line0'>Might tell a tale ’twere better leave untold.</p>
<p class='line0'>For instance, they might show us thy fair cousin,</p>
<p class='line0'>The Lady Violante, bathed in tears</p>
<p class='line0'>Of love and anger, like the maid of Colchis,</p>
<p class='line0'>Whom thou, another faithless Argonaut,</p>
<p class='line0'>Having won that golden fleece, a woman’s love,</p>
<p class='line0'>Desertest for this Glaucè.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> Hold thy peace!</p>
<p class='line0'>She cares not for me. She may wed another,</p>
<p class='line0'>Or go into a convent, and thus dying,</p>
<p class='line0'>Marry Achilles in the Elysian Fields.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Hyp.</span> (<span class='it'>rising.</span>) And so, good night! Good morning, I should say.</p>
<p class='line0'>It is no longer night, nor is it day.</p>
<p class='line0'>But in the east the paramour of Morn,</p>
<p class='line0'>Infirm and old, lifts up his hoary head,</p>
<p class='line0'>And hears the crickets chirp to mimic him.</p>
<p class='line0'>And so, once more, good night! We’ll speak more largely</p>
<p class='line0'>Of Preciosa when we meet again.</p>
<p class='line0'>Get thee to bed, and the magician, Sleep,</p>
<p class='line0'>Shall show her to thee, in his magic glass,</p>
<p class='line0'>In all her loveliness. Good night! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<span class='it'>Exit.</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Vic.</span> Good night!</p>

<p class='line0'>I have the wish, but want the will to act!</p>
<p class='line0'>Souls of great men departed! Ye whose words</p>

<p class='line0'>Like Roman swords found in the Tagus’ bed,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where is the strength to wield the arms ye bore?</p>

<p class='line0'>Like the enamor’d knight beside the fountain,</p>
<p class='line0'>Waits for upon the margin of Life’s stream;</p>
<p class='line0'>Waits to behold her rise from the dark waters,</p>
<p class='line0'>Clad in a mortal shape! Alas! how many</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In one of those stately old gardens which were
attached to every lordly mansion of the reign of
Charles the First, sat a cavalier and lady. The seat
they occupied was a rude garden sofa, overshadowed
by trees, and in close proximity to a colossal urn on
which was represented in bold relief, according to the
classic predilection of the age, Diana and her
nymphs engaged in the chase. The lady was one of
rare beauty. Indeed few creatures more lovely
than Isabel Mordaunt ever graced a festive hall, or
brushed the dew from the morning grass. She was
gay, witty, eighteen, and an heiress. Her mother
died when Isabel was an infant, and thus left chiefly
to her own control she had grown up as wilful as a
mountain chamois. Exulting in the consciousness of
talent, there were few who had not experienced her
wit. Yet she had a kind heart, and, if she was at
times too apt to give offence, no one was more
ready to atone for a fault. Her beauty and expectations
had already drawn around her crowds of suitors;
but though she laughed and chatted with all,
she suffered none to aspire to an interest in her
heart. Indeed she professed to be a skeptic to
the reality of love. But, as is ever the case, her gay
raillery and careless indifference seemed only to
increase the number of her suitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cavalier by her side was in the first flush of
manhood, and one whose personal appearance rendered
him a prize which any fair girl might be proud
to win. Grahame Vaux had been the ward of Isabel’s
father, and was but four years her senior. In childhood
they had played together, and though subsequently
separated by the departure of Vaux to the
university, they had been again thrown into each
other’s society at that critical period of life when the
heart is most keenly alive to the influences of love.
To Grahame this daily companionship was peculiarly
dangerous. Isabel was just the being to dazzle a
romantic character like his; for he regarded the sex
with all the high, chivalrous feelings which actuated
the Paladins of old, whom indeed he resembled in
other respects. A second Sir Philip Sidney, he
excelled in every graceful accomplishment. At
Oxford he had won the first prize. In every manly
sport he was pre-eminent. We will not trace the
progress of his passion—how it sprung from a single
word, fed on smiles, and finally devoured, as it were,
his very being. Suffice it to say, he soon came to
love Isabel with all the ardor of a first affection, worshiping
her as an idolator adores his divinity, and
evincing his passion in every look, word and gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps this was not the surest road to the affections
of a wilful creature like Isabel—perhaps the
alternation of doubt and fear, of admiration and indifference,
would more effectually have enlisted her
feelings; but be this as it may, her new lover met at
her hands the same capricious treatment which her
other suitors received. In Grahame’s case this wilfulness
was more than usually apparent, though there
were not wanting those who said that this demeanor
was only a veil worn to hide a growing preference
for her noble-hearted lover. At any rate her conduct
toward him was caprice itself. Now she would
smile on him so sweetly that he could not help but
hope, and now a word or gesture would plunge him
into the deepest despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can endure it no longer,” at length he said, “I
love Isabel!—Oh! how deeply and fervently God
only knows. I will terminate my suspense. I will
learn my fate. Better know the worst than live on
in this agony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose and sought out the lady. She was at her
favorite seat in the garden; and as she perceived
him approaching, her color deepened, as if she
divined, in Grahame’s excited air, the purpose of his
visit. With that instinctive desire, so natural to the
sex, to avoid the subject, she herself opened the conversation
in a gay and trifling tone. Grahame, who
could have stood the shock of battle undaunted, felt
his heart fail him when he saw her sportive mood,
but, firm in his resolve, he said, at length, at a suitable
pause,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you believe in love, Isabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love! <span class='it'>I</span> believe in love!” laughingly replied the
capricious girl. “What! give up my maiden
liberty for a pretty gallant,—oh! no, Sir Romance,
madcap as I am, it has not come to that. Believe in
love, forsooth! why I should sooner believe that men
were wise or women fickle. Love may sound very
well in a play, but I’ll have none of it. Pale cheeks,
sighs, and the gilded fetters of a wife are not for a
free maiden who, like the untamed hawk, would
soar whither she lists. Love, indeed!” and she
laughed merrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Grahame! how his sensitive heart throbbed
at these words. He would have given worlds to be
miles away. But the light, half-mocking laugh, all
silvery though it was, with which she concluded,
wrung even from him a reproach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Isabel,” he said, and his low voice trembled
with emotion, “<span class='it'>can</span> you believe all this? Ah! little
indeed then do you know of love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who would presume to think that I <span class='it'>did</span> know
ought of it?” said Isabel, with a heightened color,
and a flashing eye,—“I have no taste for jealous
lovers or domineering lords; and I never saw one of
your sex—I pray your pardon, fair sir—” and there
was a slight scorn in her words, “who could tempt
maiden to think twice of matrimony. Love indeed,
forsooth! I pray Heaven to open men’s eyes to their
vanity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment she had ceased speaking, Isabel
would have given any thing to recall her words.
Hurried away by her love of raillery, and a little
piqued at the tone of reproach in which Grahame
ventured, she had given free license to her speech,
and said things which she well knew she did not
believe. Her lover turned deadly pale at her words.
Believing now that she had all along been trifling
with his feelings, he started to his feet, and looking
at her a moment sadly, exclaimed bitterly, “Isabel!
Isabel! May God forgive you for this; I leave
you and forever;” and ere she could reply, or Grahame
see the tears that gushed into her eye, he
darted through the neighboring shrubbery and was
lost to sight. Isabel looked after, and called faintly
to him to return, but if he heard her, which was
scarcely possible, he heeded it not. Pride prevented
her from repeating the summons; she saw him no
more.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>More than an hour elapsed before Isabel returned
to the mansion, and when she did the traces of tears
were on her cheeks. She instantly sought her
chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said we parted forever—oh! surely he cannot
have meant it,” she exclaimed, “he will be here to-morrow.
And then—” and she paused, while a blush
mantled over her cheeks, and invaded even her
pearly bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to-morrow came without Grahame. All
through the long day Isabel watched for his arrival,
and even ventured half way to the park-gates, but
when she heard footsteps in the avenue ahead, she
hurried trembling behind the shrubbery until she saw
that the stranger was not her lover. And when night
came, and still he did not appear, her heart was
agitated by contending emotions; and while one
moment pride would obtain the mastery, love would
in turn subdue her bosom. Until this hour Isabel had
never known how deeply she loved Grahame; for
her passion, growing with her growth and increasing
with her years, had obtained the mastery of her heart
with such subtle and gradual power, that the rude
shock of Grahame’s departure first woke her to a
consciousness of her affection. And now she felt
that she had wronged a true and noble heart. Had
her lover then returned he would have won a ready
confession of her passion; but day after day passed
without his arrival, and finally intelligence was
received that he had joined the army of King Charles,
then first rallying around that ill-fated monarch, preparatory
to the fatal civil war in which so many gallant
cavaliers lost life and fortune. The news filled
Isabel’s heart with the keenest anguish. “Alas!
Grahame,” she said, as if in adjuration, “I love only
you, and your noble heart deems I despise the
offering. Could you but know the truth! But surely,”
she continued, “he might have sought some explanation.
Oh! if he had returned only for a moment, and
given me the opportunity to ask forgiveness, he
would not have had to complain of a cold and
ungrateful heart in Isabel Mordaunt. He is unjust,”
and thus resolving, she determined to demean herself
with becoming pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However much, therefore, Isabel might suffer in
secret, no curious eye was allowed to penetrate the
recesses of her heart. To the world she appeared
gay and witty as ever, and if sometimes the name of
Grahame was mentioned, or his gallant deeds commended,
she heard the announcement without betraying
aught more than would have been natural in a
common friend. She was often put to this trial, for,
from the moment when Grahame joined the royal
standard, his career had witnessed a succession of
the most brilliant exploits. Seeming to be utterly
regardless of life, he ventured deeds from which even
the bravest had shrunk back. Wherever the storm
of battle was thickest, wherever a post of extreme
peril was to be maintained, there was Grahame,
pressing forward in the front rank, like another
Rinaldo. He did not shun the companionship of the
gayer gallants of the camp, but he ever wore, amid
their mirth, an expression of settled sadness. But
this peculiarity was forgotten in the brilliancy of his
exploits, and his name came at length to be so famous
that when any new and daring deed was done, men
asked at once whether Sir Grahame Vaux had not
been there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabel heard all this with a beating heart, but an
unmoved cheek. She had schooled herself to disguise
her heart, and she succeeded so that no one
suspected the truth. Only her father, when he saw
her refuse one after another of her many suitors,
divined that some unrevealed secret lay hidden in her
bosom, and remembering the sudden departure of
Grahame, was at no loss to refer her conduct to
the right cause. Meantime a change had gradually
come over Isabel. She was less light-hearted than of
old—her laugh, though musical, was scarcely as gay
as it once had been—and her sportive wit no longer
flashed incessantly like the lightning in the summer
cloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tide of war had long rolled steadfastly against
the cavaliers, and finally the battle of Marston Moor
closed the tragedy. The day after the news of the
defeat arrived, a travel-soiled retainer of Grahame
reached Mordaunt Hall and recounted in detail the
events of that bloody field, from which he was a
fugitive. He said that his master, when the day was
lost, flung a discharged pistol into the thickest ranks
of the enemy and died, like a knight of old, fighting to
regain it. At these words her father turned to Isabel,
in whose presence the retainer had related his story,
and saw a deathly paleness overspread her cheek.
The next instant she sank to the floor in a swoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child, my darling Isabel, speak,” said the
aged father, raising her in his trembling arms. “Oh!
I have long suspected this, and the blow has killed
her! Why did I suffer her to hear this tale!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With difficulty they revived her; but she only
woke to a spell of sickness; and for weeks her fate
hung in a balance between life and death.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>But Grahame had not fallen. True, as his retainer
asserted, he had maintained the unequal combat long
after every one else had left the field, and true also
he had finally been overwhelmed by numbers and
left for dead, covered with wounds, upon the battle
plain; but when the pursuing squadrons had swept
by, leaving the field comparatively deserted, and
the chill night wind breathed with reviving coolness
over his brow, he awoke to consciousness, and was
enabled, by the assistance of one of his followers
who yet prowled about the scene of carnage in the
hope of finding his master, to gain a secure retreat
where he might be cured of his wounds. Here, on
the rude couch of a humble cottage, he lay for weeks,
and the third month had set in after the battle, before
he was enabled to leave his lowly shelter. During
all this time his faithful retainer watched over him,
tending him one while with the assiduity of a nurse,
and another while, on any alarm, preparing to defend
him to the last extremity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am now a houseless, persecuted outlaw,” said
Grahame when he mounted his steed to leave the
humble cottage where he had found shelter. “The
crop-eared puritanic knaves have shed the best
blood in the country and they will not spare mine.
The land is overrun with their troops, and there is
no safety, in this portion of it at least. I will go once
more to the halls of my fathers, take a last farewell of
them, and then carry my life and sword to some
foreign market, for, God help me, there is nothing else
left to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a bright sunny afternoon when Grahame
reached his ancestral halls, now deserted and melancholy.
Already had the minions of the parliament
sequestrated and shut up the mansion, and it was only
through the fidelity of an old servant, who yet lingered
around the place, that its former master was enabled
to enter its portals. The aged retainer wept with joy
on his lord’s hand, and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! dark was the day when news came of your
honor’s death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And was it then reported that I was no more?
Yet how can I wonder at it, considering my long
seclusion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! yes—and sad times too they had of it over
at Mordaunt Hall. The young mistress fainted away,
and was near dying, though since she has heard that
you yet lived—as we all did, you know, by your
messenger,—she has wonderfully revived. But
what ails you, my dear master?—are you sick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no—but I must to horse at once,” said Grahame,
whose face had turned deadly pale at his servant’s
joyful intelligence. “I may be back to sleep
here—think you I can have safe hiding for one night
in my father’s house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may you, God bless your honor,” said the
old man as Grahame rode away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She loves me, then! Life is no more all a blank,”
said the young knight almost gaily, as he dashed
through the arcades of his park, his steed seeming to
partake in his master’s exhilaration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabel sat in the great parlor of Mordaunt Hall,
looking down the broad avenue that led to the park
gates. A partial bloom had been restored to her
cheek, for hope whispered to her that Grahame might
yet be hers. Suddenly a figure emerged to sight far
down the avenue, and though years had elapsed since
she had seen that form, and though she imagined her
lover to be far away, and perhaps in exile, her heart
told her at once that the approaching figure was
Grahame’s. For a moment her agitation was so
excessive that she thought she would have fainted,
but though there were many painful recollections,
her sensations on the whole were of a happy kind.
Quick as lightning, the thought flashed across her
mind that Grahame had heard of her agitation when
the false report of his death had reached Mordaunt
Hall, and, for the moment, maidenly shame overcame
every other feeling in her bosom. Conscious
that she dare not meet her lover without preparation,
she took to instant flight, and sought, as if instinctively,
her favorite seat in the garden. Here,
resting her head on her hands, she strove to collect
her thoughts. It was not long before she heard a
tread on the graveled walk, and her whole frame
trembled with the consciousness that the intruder was
Grahame. Nervous, abashed, unable to look up,
her heart fluttered wildly against her boddice. How
different was she from the gay, capricious creature
who had occupied that same seat, two short years
before. She heard the footstep at hand, and her agitation
increased. She knew that her lover had taken
his seat beside her, and yet she dared not let her eye
meet his, but blushing and confused she offered no
resistance when he took her trembling hand in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isabel—dear Isabel!” said a manly voice, and
though the tones were full of emotion, the accents
were clear and firm, for it was not Grahame now
who trembled, “let us forget the past,” and he stole
his arm around her waist. “We love each other—do
we not, dear Isabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabel raised her eyes, now beaming with subdued
tenderness, to her lover’s face, and then bursting into
tears was drawn to his bosom, as tenderly as a
mother may press her new-born infant to her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interest of Isabel’s father, who had taken no
part in the civil war, procured for Grahame an
immunity from proscription; and when his estates
were brought to the hammer, under the order of the
parliament, they were purchased by Mr. Mordaunt,
and restored to their rightful owner. Long and happily
together lived Sir Grahame Vaux and his beautiful
wife, and when Charles the Second was restored
to his kingdom, none welcomed him back with more
joy than the now blooming matron, and her still noble
looking lord.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE LAST SHOT.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The ten minutes that elapsed before I reached the
door of the Hall seemed to be protracted to an age,
and were spent in an agony of mind no pen can describe.
Oh! to be thus deceived—to part from Annette
as we had parted—to think of her by day and
dream of her by night—to look forward to our meeting
with a thrill of hope, and strive to win renown
that I might shed a lustre around my bride—and
then, after all my toils, and hopes, and struggles, to
come back and find her wedded—God of heaven! it
was too much. But, notwithstanding my agony, my
pride revolted at the display of any outward emotion.
I would not for worlds that Annette should know the
torture her faithlessness had inflicted on my bosom.
No! I would smooth my brow, subdue my tongue,
and control my every look. I would jest, smile, and
be the gayest of the gay. I would wish Annette and
her husband a long and happy life, and no one should
suspect that, under my assumed composure, I wore
a heart rankling with a wound that no time nor circumstance
could cure. I resolved to see Annette, to
play my part to the end, and then, returning to my
post, to find an honorable death on the first deck we
should surmount. My reflections, however, were
cut short by the stoppage of the vehicle before the
door of the mansion. A servant hastened to undo
the coach steps, and, nerving myself for the interview
that was at hand, I stepped out. The man’s
face was strange to me, and I saw that it displayed
some embarrassment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you announce me to Mr. St. Clair,” I said,
“as Lieutenant Cavendish?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. St. Clair, I regret to say,” replied the man
politely, “is not at the Hall. The carriages have
just driven off, and if they had not taken the back
road through the park, would have met you in the
avenue. Mr. St. Clair accompanies the bride and
groom on a two weeks’ tour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My course was at once taken; and, as the criminal
feels a lightening of the heart when reprieved, so I
experienced a relief in escaping the trying experiment
of mingling with the bridal party. Hastily re-ascending
the carriage steps, I left my name with the
servant, and ordering the coachman to drive off, left
Pomfret Hall, with the resolution never again to return.
At the village I paused a few minutes to indite
a letter to Mr. St. Clair, in which I regretted my inopportune
arrival, and wished a long life of happiness
to him and to Annette. Then, re-entering the
coach, I threw myself back on the seat, and, while
I was being whirled away from Pomfret Hall, gave
myself up to the most bitter reflections. As I now
and then looked out of the window and recognized
familiar objects along the road, I contrasted my present
despondency with the hope that had thrilled my
heart when I passed them a few hours before. Then,
every pulse beat faster with delicious anticipations:
now, I scarcely wished for more than an honorable
death. At length my thoughts took a turn, and I reviewed
the past, calling to mind every little word
and act of Annette, from which I could draw either
hope or despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool that I was,” I exclaimed, “to think that the
wealthy heiress could stoop to love a penniless officer.
And yet,” I continued, “my fathers were as noble
as hers, aye! and enjoyed wealth and honors to
which the St. Clairs never aspired.” But again a
revulsion came across my feelings, and I said, “Oh!
Annette, Annette, could you but know my misery,
you might have paused. But God grant you may
find a heart as true to you as mine.” Thus harassed
by contending emotions, now giving way to my love,
and now yielding to indignation and pride, I spent
the day, and when at night, preparatory to retiring,
I happened to cast a look into the mirror, I started
back at my haggard appearance. But there are moments
of agony which do the work of years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My messmates, one and all, were astonished at
my speedy return, but luckily it had been determined
to put to sea at once, so that if I had remained at
Pomfret Hall until the expiration of my leave of absence
I should have lost the cruise. One or two of
my companions, who prided themselves on their
superior intelligence, gave me the credit of having,
by some unknown means, heard of the change in our
day of sailing, and so hastened my return to my
post. They little dreamed of the true cause, for to
them, as to all others, I wore the same mask of
assumed gaiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We sailed in company with <span class='sc'>The Arrow</span>, but, ere
we had been out a week, were separated from our
consort. Our orders were, in such an emergency,
to make the best of our way southward, and rendezvous
at St. Domingo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had turned in one night, after having kept watch
on deck until midnight, when, in the midst of a refreshing
sleep, I was suddenly awoke by a hand laid
on my shoulder, at the same time that a voice said⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hist! Cavendish; don’t talk in your sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I started to my feet, but, for a moment, my faculties
were in such a whirl that the dream in which
I had been reveling, mingling with the scene before
my waking senses, confused and bewildered me so
that I knew not what I uttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“St. Clair! Pomfret Hall! why your wits are
wool gathering, my dear fellow,” said the doctor—for
I now recognised my old friend—“of what have
you been dreaming? You look as if you thought me
a spectre sent to call you from Paradise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had indeed been dreaming. I fancied I was far
away, wandering amid the leafy shades of Pomfret
Hall with Annette leaning on my arm, and ever and
anon gazing up into my face with looks of unutterable
love. I heard the rustle of the leaves, the jocund
song of the birds, and the soothing sound of the
woodland waterfall, but sweeter, aye! a thousand
times sweeter than all these, came to my ears the
low whisper of my affianced bride. Was I not happy?
And we sat down on a verdant bank, and, with her
hand clasped in mine, and her fair head resting on
my bosom, we talked of the happiness which was in
store for us, and projected a thousand plans for the
future. From visions like this I awoke to the consciousness
that Annette was lost to me forever, and
that even now the smiles and caresses of which I
had dreamed were being bestowed upon another. A
pang of keenest agony, a sharp, sudden pang, as if
an icebolt had shot through my heart, almost deprived
me for a moment of utterance, and I was
fain to lean against a timber for support. But this
weakness was only momentary, for, rallying every
energy, I conquered my feelings, though not so soon
but that the doctor saw my emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sick, my dear fellow?” he said anxiously.
“No! well, you do look better now. But I
came to inform you that as rake-helly a looking craft
as ever you saw is dogging us to windward, and the
Lord only knows whether we wont all be prisoners,
and mayhap dead men, before night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hurried on my clothes, and, following him to the
deck, saw, at the first glance, that the good doctor’s
fears respecting the strange sail were not without
foundation. She was a sharp, low brig, with masts
raking far aft, and a spread of canvass towering from
her decks sufficient to have driven a sloop of war.
The haze of the morning had concealed her from
sight until within the last five minutes; but now the
broad disc of the sun, rising majestically behind her,
brought out her masts, tracery and hull in bold and
distinct relief. When first discovered, she was
within long cannon shot, but standing off to windward.
She altered her course immediately, however,
on perceiving us, and was already closing.
She carried no ensign, but there was that in her
crowded decks and jaunty air which did not permit
me to doubt a moment as to her character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A rover, by ——,” said the skipper, who had
been scrutinizing the strange sail through a glass;
“and she is treble our force,” he continued, in a
whisper to me. “We have no choice, either, but to
fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shook my head, for it was evident that escape
was impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She sails like a witch, too,” I replied, in the
same low tone, “and would overhaul us, no matter
what her position might be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we were a dozen leagues away,” said the
captain, shrugging his shoulders, “there is little
honor and no profit in fighting these cut-throats, and
if we are whipt, as we shall be, they will slit our
windpipes as if we were so many sheep in a slaughter-house.
Bah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so,” I exclaimed enthusiastically, “we will
die sword in hand. Since these murderers have
crossed our path we must, if every thing else fail,
suffer them to board us, and then blow the schooner
out of water. I myself will fire the train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, by the God above us, you speak as a brave
man should, and shame my momentary disgust, for
fear I will not call it. No, Jack Merrivale never
wanted courage, however prudence might have been
lacking. But little did I think that you, Cavendish,
would ever show less prudence than myself, as you
have to-day. You seem a changed man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am one,” I exclaimed; “but that is neither
here nor there. When once yon freebooter gets
alongside, Harry Cavendish will not be behindhand
in doing his duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My superior, at any other time, could not have
failed to notice the excitement under which I spoke,
but now his mind was too fully occupied to give my
demeanor a second thought, and our conversation
was cut short by a ball from the pirate, which,
whistling over our heads, plumped into the sea some
fathoms distant. At the same instant a mass of
dark bunting shot up to the gaff of the brig, and,
slowly unrolling, blew out steadily in the breeze,
disclosing a black flag, unrelieved by a single emblem.
But we well knew the meaning of that
ominous ensign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He taunts us with his accursed flag,” said the
skipper energetically; “by the Lord that liveth, he
shall feel that freemen know how to defend their
lives and honor. Call aft the men, and then to quarters.
We will blow yon scoundrels out of water, or
die on the last plank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never did I listen to more vehement, more soul-stirring
eloquence than that which rolled, like a tide
of fire, from the captain’s lips when the men had
gathered aft. Every eye flashed with indignation,
every bosom heaved with high and noble daring, as he
pointed impetuously to the foe and asked if there was
one who heard him that wished to shrink from the
contest. To his impassioned appeal they answered
with a loud huzza, brandishing their cutlasses above
their heads and swearing to stand by him to the last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, my brave boys—I remember how you
fought the privateer’s men,” for most of his old crew
had re-entered, “but yonder cut-throats are still
more deceitful and blood-thirsty. We have nothing
to hope for from them but a short shrift and the yard-arm.
We fight, not for our country and property
alone, but for our lives also. The little <span class='sc'>Falcon</span> has
struck down too many prizes already, to show the
coward’s feather now. Let us make these decks
slippery with our best blood rather than surrender.
Stand by me, if they board us, and—my word on it—the
survivors will long talk of this glorious day.
And now, my brave lads, splice the main-brace, and
then to quarters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another cheer followed the close of this harangue,
when the men gathered at their quarters, each one
as he passed to his station receiving a glass of grog.
As I ran my eye along the decks, and saw the stalwart
frames and flashing eyes of the crew, I felt
assured that the day was destined to be desperately
contested; and when I thought of the vast odds
against which we had to contend, and the glorious
deeds which this superiority would make room for,
I experienced an exultation which I cannot describe.
The time for which, in the bitterness of my heart, I
had prayed, was come; and I resolved to dare things
this day which, if they ever reached the ears of Annette,
should prove to her that I died the death of
a gallant soldier. The thought that, perhaps, she
might regret me when I was gone, was sweeter to
me than the song of many waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little time, however, was left for such emotions,
for scarcely had the men taken their stations when
the pirate, who had hitherto been manœuvering for a
favorable position and only occasionally firing a shot,
opened his batteries on us, discharging his guns in such
quick succession that his sides seemed one continuous
blaze, and his tall masts were to be seen reeling
backwards from the shock of his broadside. Instantaneously
the iron tempest came hurtling across us,
and for a space I was bewildered by the rending of
timbers, the falling of spars, and the agonizing shrieks
of the wounded. The main-top-mast came rattling
to the deck with all its hamper at the very moment
that a messmate fell dead beside me. For a few
minutes all was consternation and confusion. So
rapid had been the discharges, and so well aimed
had been each shot, that, in the twinkling of an eye,
we saw ourselves almost a wreck on the water, and
comparatively at the mercy of our foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clear away this hamper,” shouted the skipper,
“stand to your guns forward there, and give it to the
pirate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the word the two light pieces and the gun
amidships opened on the now rapidly closing foe; but
the metal of all except the swivel was so light that
it did no perceptible damage on the thick-ribbed hull
of our antagonist. The ball from the long eighteen,
however, swept the decks of the foe, and appeared
to have carried no little havoc in its course. But
the broadside did not check the approach of the
rover. His object was manifestly to run us afoul
and board us. Steadily, therefore, he maintained his
course, swerving scarcely a hair’s breadth at our
discharge, but keeping right on as if scorning our
futile efforts to check his progress. We did not,
however, intermit our exertions. Although crippled
we were not disheartened—despairing, we entertained
no thought of submission, but rallying around
our guns, we fought them like lions at bay, firing with
such rapidity that our decks, and the ocean around,
soon came to be almost obscured in the thick fleecy
veil of smoke that settled slowly on the water.
Every few minutes a ball from the pirate whizzed by
in our immediate vicinity, or crashed among our
spars; but the increasing clouds of vapor, clinging
about the pathway of our foe as well as of ourselves,
made his fire naturally less deadly than at first. For
a short space we even lost sight of our antagonist,
and the gunners paused, uncertain where to fire; but
suddenly the lofty spars of the pirate were seen
riding above the white fog, scarcely a pistol shot
from us, and in another minute, with a deafening
crash, the rover ran us aboard, his bowsprit jamming
in our fore-rigging as he approached us head on.
Almost before we could recover from our surprise
we heard a stern voice crying out in the Spanish
tongue for boarders, and immediately a dark mass of
ruffians gathered, like a cluster of bees, on the bowsprit
of the foe, with cutlasses brandished aloft, preparatory
to a descent on our decks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rally to repel boarders!” thundered the skipper,
springing forward, “ho! beat back the bloodhounds
from your decks,” and with the word, he made a blow
at a desperado who, at that moment, sprang into the
fore-rigging; when my superior drew back his sword
it was red with the heart’s blood of the assailant,
who, falling heavily backwards with a dull plash,
squatted a second on the water, like a wounded
water-fowl, and then sank forever. For a single
breath his companions stood appalled, and then, with
a savage yell, leaping on our decks, fiercely attacked
our little band. In vain our gallant tars disputed
every inch of ground—in vain one after another of
the assailants dyed the deck with his blood—in vain
by word and deed the skipper incited the crew to
almost gigantic exertions; nothing could resist the
overpowering tide of assailants which poured on in
an unremitting stream from the brig, bearing down
every thing before it as an avalanche from the hills.
Step by step our brave lads were steadily forced
backwards, until at length the whole forecastle was
in possession of the foe, and a solid mass of freebooters
was advancing on the starboard side of the open
main-hatch, in eager pursuit of the retreating crew.
I had foreseen this result to the conflict, and instead,
therefore, of aiding to repel the boarders, had been
engaged in loading one of the lighter guns with
grape, and dragging it around, so as to command
this very path;—a duty which I had been enabled to
perform unnoticed by either party in the fierce excitement
of the <span class='it'>mêlée</span>. I had hardly masked my little battery,
and not three minutes had elapsed from the first
onset of the boarders, when my messmates came
driving towards me, as I have described, beaten in
by the solid masses of the enemy. Already the fugitives
had passed the hatchway, and the foremost
desperados of the assailing column were even now
within three feet of the muzzle of my gun, when I
signed to my confederate to jerk off the tarpaulin
which had masked our piece. The pirates started
back in horror when they saw their peril, but I gave
them no time to escape. Quick as lightning I applied
the match, and the whole fiery cataract was belched
upon them. Language cannot depict the fearful
havoc of that discharge. The hurricane of fire and
shot mowed its way lengthwise, through the narrow
and crowded column, scattering the dying and the
dead beneath its track, as a whirlwind uproots the
forest trees; while groans, and imprecations, and
shrieks of anguish rent the air, drowning the sounds
of the explosion, and the crashing of the grape,
amongst its victims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now charge!” I shouted, as if seized with a
sudden frenzy, springing into the very midst of the
foe, “charge them, my gallant braves, and sweep the
murderers from the deck. No quarter to the knaves!
Hew them to the brisket,” and following every word
with a blow, and seconded by our men who seemed
to catch my fury, we made such havoc among those
of the pirates whom the grape had spared, that,
astonished, paralized, disconcerted, and finally
struck with mortal fear, they fled wildly from the
schooner, some regaining their craft by the bowsprit,
some plunging overboard and swimming to her,
and some leaping headlong into the deep never to rise
again. Seizing an axe, and springing forward, I
hastily cut our hamper loose from the foe, and with
the next swell the two vessels slowly parted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now to your guns, my men,” shouted the skipper,
unconscious of a dangerous wound, in the excitement
of the moment, “give it to them before they can
rally to their quarters. Fire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We poured in our broadsides like hail, riddling
even the solid sides of our foe, and making his decks
slippery with blood, and all this before the discomfited
freebooters could rally to their guns and return
our shots. Our men, fired with an enthusiasm which
approached to madness, loaded with a speed that
seems to me now incredible, and the third broadside
was shaking every timber of our little craft, before
a solitary gun was discharged in reply from the
pirate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! he has woke up at last,” said my old friend,
the captain of our long Tom, “and she may yet regain
the day if we don’t fight like devils. Bring me
that shot from the galley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In God’s name, what do you mean?” said I, as
he coolly sat down by his piece. “In with the ball
and let the rover have it—not a moment is to be lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye! I knows that, leftenant; and here comes
the settler for which I waited,” he exclaimed, as the
cook brought a red-hot shot from the galley, “I
thought I’d venture on a little experiment of my
own, and I’ve seen ’em do wonders with these fiery
comets afore now. There—there she has it,” he
exclaimed, as the shot was sent home, “now God
have mercy on them varmint’s souls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From some strange, unaccountable presentiment,
I stepped mechanically backward and cast an eye at
the brig, which had now floated to some distance.
As I did so, a trail of fire glanced before my sight,
and I saw the simmering shot enter her side.
Thought was not quicker than the explosion
which followed, shaking the sea beneath and the
sky above, and almost deafening the ear with its unearthly
concussion, while instantaneously a gush of
flame shot far up into the sky; the masts of the vessel
were lifted perpendicularly upwards, and the whole
air was filled with shattered timbers and mangled
human bodies that fell the next minute pattering
around us into the deep. Oh God! the fearful sight!
The shrieks of the wounded and drowning—the
awful struggles of the poor wretches in the water—the
sullen cloud that settled over the scene of death,
will they ever pass away from my memory? But I
drop a veil over a sight too horrible to recount.
Suffice it to say, of all the rover’s crew, not one survived
to see that sun go down. A few we picked up
with our boats, but they died ere night. The cause
of the explosion is soon told. The brig’s magazine
had been struck and fired by our <span style='font-size:smaller'>LAST SHOT</span>.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1.3em;font-weight:bold;'>TO AMERICAN AUTHORS AND THE AMERICAN PRESS</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>IN BEHALF OF AN INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>:—You have the credit, at this moment,
of ruling the world—at least your part of it;
and cannot yet enact a single statute by which your
share of worldly right and profit shall be secured to
you. Walking, in the world’s eye, as strong and
beautiful as angels, you cannot perform the day’s
work, counted either in money or in bill-making influence,
of a rude Missourian or a lean Atlantic
citizen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aiding, as you do, by your inventive genius in all
the great enterprises of the day—pushing forward
every great and good undertaking to an issue of success—you
lack the will or the skill to create a simple
mill-contrivance by which your grain may be ground
and bread furnished to your board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You project, but do not realize. You sow, but do
not reap. You sail to and fro—merchantmen and
carriers to all the world of thought—the whole ocean
over, but find no harbor and acquire no return. How
much longer you will consent to keep the wheels of
opinion in motion: to do the better part of the thinking
and writing of these twenty-six States, without
hire or fee, it rests with you to say. I merely put the
case to you to see how it strikes you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I address you in the mass, writers of books and
framers of paragraphs together, because, at bottom,
all who wield the pen have interests in common;
and because I am anxious (I confess it) to have the
whole force of the Press, whatever shape it takes,
combined and consolidated against an injustice which
could not live an hour if the Press knew its rights
and its strength. The rights and the respectability
of the one are, in the end, the rights and the respectability
of the other; based in both cases on the worth
and dignity of literary property.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No community is secure, it seems to me, where
any law or fundamental right is systematically violated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Either by instant vindication, through blood, and
pillage, and massacre; or by the more silent and
deadlier agency of the opposite wrong and a whole
brood of fierce allies sprung from its loins, is this
truth, at all times, asserted and made good. From
the original wrong, lying in many cases close to the
heart of society, there spreads a secret and invisible
atmosphere of pestilence, in which all kindred rights
moulder and decay, until their life at last goes out
at a moment when no man had guessed at such a
result. Neither statesmen nor people are, therefore,
wise in tampering with a single principle: or in
yielding a jot of the immutable truth to plausible
emergency or the fair-seeming visage of an immediate
good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The law of property, in all its relations and aspects,
is one of these primary anchors and fastenings of the
social frame. And what evils, I am asked, have
grown from the alleged neglect of literary property?
I will mention one by way of illustration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You are all of you aware, by this time, that the
extensive printing and publishing establishment of
Harper &amp; Brothers, Cliff street, New York, was
burned in the early part of June; and that a heavy
loss accrued to them from the burning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire was attributed, immediately after it occured,
by the public prints to the hand of design.
“<span class='it'>It is supposed that one object of the incendiaries
was to obtain copies of a new novel, by James, of
which the Messrs. Harper had the exclusive possession.</span>”
Another paper enlarges this statement—“we
see suspicions expressed that the object was to
get possession of a new novel, ‘Morley Ernstein,’
which was in sheets, <span class='it'>for cheap publication</span>.” Here
is a natural, logical sequence, and just such a one as
might have been expected. If the conjecture should
not prove a fact, it ought to be one, because this is
just the period and the very order in which we might
expect an incident of this kind to occur; perhaps
not on quite so large a scale, nor with the necessary
melo-dramatic admixture of fire. It might have been
a plain burglary, prying a ware-house door open with
a bar, for a copy; or, knocking a man over, at the
edge of evening, and plucking the sheets from under
his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Piracy and burning are, perhaps, so nearly akin
that, after all, they have wrought out the sequence
more naturally than if it had been left to the friends
of copyright to suggest to them in what order they
should occur. In Elia’s legend, a building is burned
that a famishing Chinaman may have roast pig; in
the reality of the present fire a publisher’s warehouse
was put in flames, not only to prevent a famishing
author from having roast pig in <span class='it'>presenti</span>, but also, by
a decisive blow, to further the good principle, that
there should be no roast pig (nor even salt and a
radish) for famishing authors in all future time. Let
it not be said I press this point, a mere surmise, too
far. Surmise as it is, it receives countenance and
consistency from a previous fact, namely, that one
of the large republishing newspapers was charged,
not long since, by the other—and this was made a
matter for the Sessions—with the felony of abstracting
the sheets of an English work from the office of
its rival. This—an invasion of property—is only
one of the external evils growing out of a false and
lawless state of things. Of others which strike
deeper; which create confusion and error of opinion;
which tend to unsettle the lines that divide nation
from nation; to obliterate the traits and features
which give us a characteristic individuality as a nation—there
will be another and more becoming opportunity
to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As it is, by fair means or foul, the weekly newspaper
press, with its broad sheet spread to the breeze,
is making great head against the slow-sailing progress
of such as trust to the more regular trade-winds
for their speed. And this, fortunately (as error
cannot long abide in itself,) is creating changes of
opinion of infinite advantage to the great cause of
international copyright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little while ago, we had the publishers petitioning
and declaiming against an international copyright,
(I forget what arguments they employed;) and,
lo! their breath is scarcely spent when the ground
slides from under them, and the whole publishing
business—at least a considerable section of it—which
they meant to uphold by false and hollow
props, has tumbled into chaos, and an organic change
has passed through the world of publication. Now
they begin—and we are glad to have so powerful
and so respectable a body convert to our side, on
whatever terms—to see the matter in a new light;
the affection for the people, and the cheap enlightenment
of the people, and the people’s wives and children,
which they made bold (out of an exceeding philanthropy)
to proclaim in market-places and the lobbies
of Congress, is wonderfully dwindled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It isn’t a pleasant thing, after all, to have one’s
printing-house and bindery burned to the ground,
even for so laudable an object. Suppose we have
the law: a little civilized recognition of the rights of
authors (merely by way of clincher, however, to the
absolute, primary and indefeasible rights of publishers)
might be an agreeable change from this barbarous
system of non-protection. The old plan, it
must be admitted, has its disadvantages. Let’s have
the law! And here you may suppose the hats of
certain old, respected and enterprising publishers to
rise into the air, in a sort of fervor or ecstasy, which
it is entirely out of their power to control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is there or is there not a property in a book: a
primitive, real, fundamental right in its ownership
as in any estate or property? Often and clearly as
this question has been determined, the opponents
of a law, by stress of argument, are driven upon denying
it over and over again, and making use of
every sort of ridiculous and irrelevant illustration to
crowd the right out of the way. They fly into all
corners of creation in pursuit of an analogy, and
come back without as much as a sparrow in their
bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of them, for example, says, “We buy a new
foreign book; it is ours; we multiply copies and
diffuse its advantages. We also buy a bushel of
foreign wheat, before unknown to us; we cultivate,
increase it, and spread its use over the country.
Where is the difference? If one is stealing, the
other is so. Nonsense! neither is stealing. They
are both praiseworthy acts, beneficial to mankind,
injurious to nobody, right and just in themselves, and
commendable in the sight of God.” This reasoner,
of a pious inclination and most excellent moral tendencies,
has made but a single error—he thinks the
type, stitching and paper are <span style='font-size:smaller'>THE BOOK</span>! He forgets
that when you buy a book you do not buy the whole
body of its thoughts in their entire breadth and construction,
to be yours in fee simple for all uses, (if
you did, the vender would be guilty of a fraud in selling
more than a single copy of any one work;) but
simply the usufruct of the book as a reader. Any
processes of your own mind exerted upon that
work, or parts of it, make the result, so far, your
legitimate property, and is one of the incidents of
your purchase. To reprint the work in any shape,
as a complete, symmetrical composition, is a violation
of the original contract between the vender and
yourself; whether it be in folio or duodecimo, in the
form of newspaper or pamphlet—there lies <span style='font-size:smaller'>THE
BOOK</span>, unchanged by any action of your own mind.
The wheat, of which you have purchased the bushel,
in the mean time has been sown in your field, (there’s
a difference to begin;) which has been prepared by
your plough and plough-horse for its reception; the
kindly dews and rains of heaven—which would
answer to the genial inspirations and movements of
the mind, in the other case—descend upon it; it is
guarded by walls and hedges from inroad; the weeds
and tares which would fain choke it are plucked out
by a careful hand; at last it is reaped and gathered
in by the harvestman to his garners. The one bushel
has become a thousand; but it has passed through a
thousand appropriating and fructifying processes to
swell it to that extent. It has not been merely poured
out of one bushel measure into another bushel measure.
Though the one plough the earth, and the
other plough the sea, the world will recognize a distinction,
a delicate line of demarcation between
farmer (man’s first occupation) and pirate (his last.)
The republishers—the proprietors of the mammoth
press—groan under the aspersion of piracy and pillage
laid at their door: they complain of the harshness
of epithet which denounces them as Kyds and
MacGregors. They must bear in mind that authors
and republishers are likely to regard this question
from very different points of view: that the poor
writer, regarding himself as plundered, defrauded of
a positive right, and of a property as real and substantial
as guineas, or dollars, or doubloons, may feel
a soreness of which the other party, living as he does
on the denial of that right, and the seizure of that
property, without charge or cost, may not be quite
as susceptible. Let us make an effort to bring this
point home to these gentlemen in an obvious and intelligible
illustration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How would the worthy proprietors of “The Brother
Jonathan” like it, if, when their editions of Barnaby
Rudge or Zanoni had been carefully worked
off, at some expense of composition, paper and press-work,
and lay ready folded in their office for delivery:
How would they be pleased if, just at that moment,
when the newsboys were gathered at the office door,
pitching their throats for the new cry, a gang of
stout-handed fellows should descend upon their premises,
and without as much as “by your leave,” or,
“gentlemen an you will!” sweep the entire edition
off, bear it into the next street, and there proceed to
issue and vend it with the utmost imaginable steadiness
of aspect, with an equanimity of demeanor
quite edifying and perfect? Why, gentlemen, to
speak the truth plainly, you would have a hue-and-cry
around the corner in an instant! <span class='it'>Your</span> ejaculations
of thief, robber and burglar would know no
pause till you were compelled to give over for very
lack of breath; and the whole community would be
startled, at its breakfast the next morning, by an appeal
to its moral sensibilities so loud and lightning-like,
that the coffee would be unpalatable, and the
very toast turn to a cinder in the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, it should be borne in mind that the large
weekly press, whose influence we are anxious to
counteract, and whose interest is rapidly becoming
the leading one in opposition to the proposed law,
has arisen since the agitation of this question; has
embarked its capital, and has grown to its present
power and influence in the very teeth of a solemn
protest of the authors whose labors they appropriate.
It should also, in fairness, be added that some members
of this huge fraternity only avail themselves of
this law as it now stands, as they think they have a
right, and hold themselves ready to abandon the
field or adapt themselves to the change whenever a
new law requires it; in the mean time, meeting the
question fairly, and reasoning it through in good
temper. The very paper which I have employed in
illustration is chargeable with no offence against
literature, society, or good morals, save the single
taint of appropriating the labors of authors without
pay, and defending the appropriation as matter of
strict right and propriety. Only in a community
where a contempt for literary rights has been engendered
by long mal-practice, could such sentiments
have obtained lodgment in minds of general fairness
and honesty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the hostility to a law of reciprocal copyright be
as deep rooted as is alleged, why has there not been
some able argument (raised above sordid considerations,
and looking wide and far upon the question in
all its vast bearings) expounding to us the grounds
on which this professed antagonism is based? When
we ask them for a syllogism they give us an assertion.
“My dear sir, how can you waste time, perplexing
yourself and the public with this barren
question! We supply readers with a novel, a good
three-volume novel, for a shilling; and as long as
we do that they will remain deaf to all your appeals.
The <span class='it'>argumentum ad crumenam</span>, the syllogism of the
pocket has, in all ages, carried the sway!” This is
the head and front of their declamation, of their invective
and their facts. This is <span class='it'>the</span> Fact! This boulder
(offered in lieu of bread) they beg us of the author-tribe
to digest: this is their bulwark, their fortress—no,
their burrow rather—into which they skulk at
the approach of a poor author, quill in hand, prepared
to drive off the game—<span class='it'>feræ naturæ</span>—that lay
waste his preserves and make free in his clover-field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now of all arguments this of cheapness is most
questionable and unsafe. It has a comely and alluring
visage, is smooth-spoken and full of promise, but
we must have a caution where it may lead us, for it
is as full of trick and foul play as a canting quaker;
as precarious a foothold as the trap of the scaffold
the minute before the check is slipped. Cheap and
good are a pleasant partnership: but it does not
happen that they always do business together.
Taking cheapness as our guide and conductor, we
can readily make our way, in imagination, to a publishing
shop where the principle is expanded into
a pleasing practical illustration. The shop is of
course in a cellar, (rent twelve shillings a quarter;)
the attendant is a second-hand man cast off from the
current population of the upper world into this depository
(wages seven shillings a week;) his hat,
being still on the cheap tendency, has followed him
out of Chatham street in company with a coat rejected
of seven owners, the last of whom was a dustman,
trowsers to match and boots borrowed of a pauper (cost
of the entire outfit five shillings and a penny;) behind
a counter that totters to the earth at an expense of
five pence or more for repairs, he dispenses the frugal
Literature of which he is the genius—the paper
being of such an exquisite delicacy and cheapness
that a good eye, by glancing through, can read both
sides at once; the purchaser plunges down with a
sixpence (most economical of small coin) in his
pocket, and bears off, in a triumphant apotheosis,
four and twenty columns to be read by the light of a
tallow twopenny that sputters cheapness as it burns.
This is the glory of the age; the crowning honor
and triumph of America. Who would have the
heart or the hardihood to blur that fair picture of
popular knowledge and cheap enjoyment? Why,
sirs—to speak a serious word or two in your ear—this
plea of cheapness—a miserable escape at best,
where a question of right and wrong is concerned—pushed
to its extreme (and as cheapness is urged as
the sole criterion and measure of advantage, we are
warranted in so doing,) would drive literature to the
almanac, which can be afforded at a penny; and the
age of the brown ballad would return upon us with
all its primitive graces of an unclean sheet, a cloudy
typography, and a style of thought and expression
quite as pure and lucid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pass a copyright bill and we are told, “we should
soon learn the difference between £1 10, the London
price of Bulwer’s Zanoni, and the American
price of twenty-five cents.” How long—it is triumphantly
asked—would our “reading public, almost
commensurate with the entire population, continue
at such a rate?”—what if it did not last a minute?
Truth and honesty are of a little more worth than a
reading public even as wide as the borders of the
land. Of the elevation of the people—the instruction
of the people, I hold myself a friend—no man more:
but I do not propose to begin their enlightenment
with a new version of the decalogue; so amended
as to admit all the opposites against which it is directed,
as virtues which we are enjoined to cultivate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suppose these gentlemen do furnish your literature
at a low price by dint of paying the author nothing,
they should bear in mind that there is a place where
it is paid for, or it would most assuredly prove as miserable
as it is cheap. The literature is valuable, not
because they spread it before the world in large
sheets, every Saturday morning, at sixpence a copy;
but because there happened to be in another country
certain enterprising publishers, of a somewhat different
stamp, who thought it worth their while to cheer
the writer in his labors by paying him a good round
sum for his copyright. I repeat it, an unpaid literature
cannot contend with a paid one; nor can it—while
money is a representative of value and a motive
of exertion—be as good. Do I imagine then
that an international law will create great writers?
Not at all. Under any law—oppressed by whatever
bondage or tyranny custom chooses to lay upon them—men
of great genius will struggle into light and
cast before the world the thoughts with which their
own souls have been moved. They will speak
though mountains pressed upon them. But there is
a wide class—comprising the body of a national literature—who
can claim no such power; essayists,
philosophers, whose impulses are not great, periodical
writers—all are silent when the law and the
trade fail to befriend them. It is these that need the
constant stimulus—the genial inspiration (denied to
them in any great measure by Nature) of pay. It is
the shining gold—decry it as we may—that breeds
the shining thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be asked, how does this question affect the
Press? The Press, forming a part of the great body
of writers, is affected by whatever affects the writers
of books; for the bond by which the entire brotherhood
is held together, is so close that it cannot be
struck in any part without feeling the shock in its
whole length. The same injustice by which the
author falls in station and place, drags down the
journalist. The rights of all who use the pen are
rights in common; varying only in degree, and, as
they may be affected from time to time, by circumstances
of the hour or day. Beyond this the actual
and immediate pressure of a vast amount of reading
from abroad, poured upon us without limit or regulation,
begins to be felt by the daily and weekly
Press. They find attention drawn off from the article
or political speculation in their own columns,
prepared with care and judgment, to the cheap reprint;
and are driven upon abandoning the field or
joining in a pernicious system of unpaid appropriation
against which their better judgment revolts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now close this Appeal, and in doing so I would
venture to urge upon you the importance of concert
and a steady action in behalf of this law, at all
times and in all places where you are called on to
employ that sacred instrument of thought, whose
immunities are so grossly outraged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The popular mind has, in this country, made wonderful
advances in the appreciation of political truths
and principles. There is no reason why it should
not make an equal—though perhaps a later—progress
in truths that relate to literature and art. The popular
mind, as all our institutions require, is essentially
just and true; and, once enlightened by a sufficient
array of facts, and with time to arrange and digest
them, will act with energy and wisdom—on this as
on all other questions of which it is the arbiter.
Depend upon it this bill, although adversely regarded
by your Senate and Representatives at this time,
will ultimately triumph. It will go up to the Senate-chamber,
year after year, with new facts, pleading
for it with an urgency which considerate legislators
cannot resist. In the mean time it is your duty, as I
trust it is your desire, to enlighten the general mind
as to the truths on which I have ventured to insist.
Seize the instant. In town, in homestead and city,
let these principles be spread as wide as the writings
they would protect; and search, with a fearless eye,
the national heart to find whether there be not some
kindly corner where it is willing the seeds of a national
literature should be lodged. Speaking in the
accents of persuasion with which God and Nature
have endowed you; and through the organs of opinion
which every one of you may, more or less, command—you
cannot be long resisted. Together, in a
phalanx, before which kings and princes grow pale,
enter upon the mighty task. Hand in hand, voice
answering to voice, in tones of mutual trust and cheerful
hope press forward in the noble labor to which
you are summoned. That Union which, in politics
and war, is Strength, will prove in Literature, as
well, your champion and deliverer.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY H. W. HERBERT, AUTHOR OF “RINGWOOD THE ROVER,” “THE BROTHERS,” “CROMWELL,” ETC. ETC.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>When next she opened her eyes, she lay on her
own bed, in her own well known chamber, and her
old nurse, with the good vicar’s wife, was watching
over her—as her lids rose and she looked about her,
all her intelligence returned upon the moment, and
she was perfectly aware of all that had already
passed, of all that she had still to undergo. “Well—”
she replied to the eager and repeated inquiries
after her state of body and sensations which were
poured out from the lips of her assiduous watchers—“Oh!
I feel quite well, I do assure you—I was not
hurt at all—not in the least—only I was so foolish as
to faint from terror—but Marian, how is Marian?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not injured in the least, but very anxious about
you, sweet Annabel,” replied good mistress Summers—“so
much so that I was obliged to force her from
the chamber, so terrible was her grief, so violent her
terror and excitement—Lord De Vaux snatched her
from the horse and saved her, before he even saw
your danger—he too is in a fearful state of mind, he
has been at the door twenty times, I believe, within
the hour—hark, that is his foot now—will you see
him, dearest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A quick and chilly shudder ran through the whole
frame of the lovely girl, and a faint hue glowed once
again in her pale cheek, but mastering her feelings,
she made answer in her own notes of sweet calm
music—“Not yet, dear mistress Summers—not yet—but
tell him, I beseech you, that I am better—well
indeed! and will receive his visit by and by—and in
the mean time, my good friend, I must see Marian—must
see her directly and alone—No! no!” she added,
seeing that the old lady was about to remonstrate—“No!
no! you must not hinder me of my
desire—you know—” she went on, with a faint, very
melancholy smile—“you know, of old, I am a wilful
stubborn girl when I make up my mind—and it is
quite made up now, my good friend—so, pray you,
let me see her—I am quite strong enough I do assure
you—so do you, I beseech you, go and console my
lord; and let nurse bring me Marian!—” So firmly
did she speak, and so resolved was the expression of
her soft gentle features, that they no longer hesitated
to comply with her request, and both retired with
soft steps from the chamber. Then Annabel half
uprose from the pillows which had propped her, and
clasped her hands in attitude of prayer, and turned
her beautiful eyes upward—her lips moved visibly,
not in irregular impulsive starts, but with a smooth
and ordered motion, as she prayed fervently indeed
but tranquilly, for strength to do, and patience to
endure, and grace to do and to endure alike with
Christian love and Christian fortitude. While she
was thus engaged, a quick uncertain footstep, now
light and almost tripping, now heavy and half faltering,
approached the threshold—a gentle hand raised
the latch once, and again let it fall, as if the comer
was fluctuating between the wish to enter and some
vague apprehension which for the moment conquered
the desire. “Is it you, Marian?—” asked the lovely
sufferer—“oh! come in, come in, sister!—” and she
did come in, that bright lovely creature, her naturally
high complexion almost unnaturally brilliant now
from the intensity of her hot blushes, her eyes were
downcast, and she could not so much as look up into
the sad sweet face of Annabel; her whole frame
trembled visibly as she approached the bed, and her
foot faltered very much, yet she drew near, and sitting
down beside the pillow, took Annabel’s hand
tenderly between her own, and raised it to her warm
lips and kissed it eagerly and often. Never for a
moment’s space did the eyes of Annabel swerve from
her sister’s features, from the moment she entered
the door until she sat down by her side, but rested on
them steadily as if through them they would peruse
the secret soul with a soft gentle scrutiny, that savored
not at all of sternness or reproach—at last, as if
she was now fully satisfied, she dropped her eyelids
and for a little space kept them close shut, while
again her lips moved silently—and then pressing her
sister’s hand fondly, she said in a quiet soothing
voice, as if she were alluding to an admitted fact
rather than asking a question, “So you have met
him before, Marian?—” a violent convulsion shook
every limb of her whom she addressed, and the blood
rushed in torrents to her brow—she bowed her head
upon her sister’s hand, and burst into a paroxysm of
hysterical tears and sobbing, but answered not a
word. “Nay! nay! dear sister,” exclaimed Annabel,
bending down over her and kissing her neck
which like her brow and cheeks was absolutely
crimson—“Nay! nay! sweet Marian, weep not thus,
I beseech you, there is no wrong done—none at all—there
was no wrong in your seeing him, when you
did so—it was at York, I must believe—nor in your
<span class='it'>loving</span> him either, when you did so—for I had not
then seen him, and of course could not love him.
But it was <span class='it'>not</span> right, sweetest Marian, to let me be in
ignorance—only think, dearest; only think, what
would have been my agony, when I had come to
know after I was a wife, that in myself becoming
happy I had brought misery on my second <span class='it'>self</span>—my
own sweet sister!—nay!—do not answer me yet,
Marian, for I can understand it all—almost all, that
is—and I quite appreciate your motives—I am sure
that you did not know that <span class='it'>he loved you</span>—for he does
love you, Marian—but fancied that he loved me
only, and so resolved to control yourself, and crush
your young affections, and sacrifice yourself for me—thank
God! oh! thank God, dearest, that your
strength was not equal to the task—for had it been
so we had been most wretched—oh! most wretched.
But you must tell me all about it, for there is much I
cannot comprehend—when did you see him first, and
where?—why did he never so much as hint to me
that he had known you?—why, when I wrote you
word that he was here, and after that I liked—loved—was
about to marry him—why did you never write
back that you knew him?—and why, above all,
when you came and found him here—here in your
mother’s house—why did you meet him as a stranger?—I
know it will be painful to you, dear one;
but you must bear the pain, for it is necessary now
that there shall be no more mistakes—be sure of one
thing, dearest Marian, that I will never wed him—oh!
not for worlds!—I could not sleep one night!—no
not one hour in the thought that my bliss was
your bane—but if he love you, as he ought, and as
you love him, sister, for I can read your soul, he
shall be yours at once, and I shall be more happy so—more
happy tenfold—than pillowing my head upon
a heart which beats for any other—but he must explain—he
must explain all this—for I much fear me
he has dealt very basely by us both—I fear me
much, he is a bold false man⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! no!” cried Marian eagerly, raising her clear
eyes to her sister’s, full of ingenuous truth and zealous
fire—“No! no! he is all good, and true, and noble!—I—it
is I only who have, for once, been false and
wicked—not altogether wicked, Annabel—perhaps
more foolish than to blame, at least in my intentions—but
you shall hear all—you shall hear all, Annabel,
and then judge for yourself—” and then still looking
her sister quite steadily and truthfully in the face, she
told her how, at a ball in York, she had met the young
nobleman, who had seemed pleased with her, danced
with her many times, and visited her, but never once
named love, nor led her in the least to fancy he
esteemed her beyond a chance acquaintance—“But I
loved him—oh! <span class='it'>how</span> I loved him, Annabel—almost
from the first time I saw him—and I feared ever—ever
and only—that by my bold frank rashness, he
might discover his power, and believe me forward
and unmaidenly—weeks passed, and our intimacy
ripened, and I became each hour more fondly, more
devotedly, more madly,—for it was madness all!—enamored
of him. He met me ever as a friend; no
more! The time came when he was to leave York,
and as he took leave of me he told me that he had
just received despatches from <span class='it'>his</span> father directing
him to visit <span class='it'>mine</span>; and I, shocked by the coolness of
his parting tone, and seeing that indeed he had no
love for me, scarcely noting what he said, told him
not that I had <span class='it'>no father</span>—but I did tell him that I had
one sweet sister, and suddenly extorted from him, unawares,
a promise that he would never tell you he
had known me—my manner, I am sure, was strange
and wild, and I have no doubt that my words were
so likewise—for his demeanor altered on the instant—his
air, which had been that of quiet friendship,
became cool, chilling, and almost disdainful, and
within a few minutes he took his leave, and we
never met again till yester even. You will, I doubt
not, ask me wherefore I did all this—I cannot tell
you—I was mad, mad with love and disappointment,
and the very instant he said that he was coming
hither, I knew as certainly that he would love you,
and you him, Annabel, as though it had been palpably
revealed to me. I could not write of him to you—I
<span class='it'>could</span> not!—and when your letters came and we
learned that he was here, I confessed all this to our
aunt, and though she blamed me much for wild and
thoughtless folly, she thought it best to keep the
matter secret. This is the whole truth, Annabel—the
whole truth! I fancied that the absence, the knowledge
that I should see him next my sister’s husband,
the stern resolve with which I bound my soul, had
made me strong to bear his presence—I tried it, and
I found myself, how weak—this is all, Annabel; can
you forgive me, sister?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sweet, innocent Marian,” exclaimed the elder
sister through her tears, for she had wept constantly
through the whole sad narration, “there is not any
thing for me to forgive—you have wronged yourself
only, my poor sister!—But yet—but yet!—I cannot
understand it—he must have seen—no <span class='it'>man</span> could
fail to see that one so frank and artless, as you are,
Marian, was in love with him—he must, if not
before, have known it certainly when you extorted
from him, as you call it, that strange promise—besides
he loves <span class='it'>you</span>, Marian; he loves you—then
wherefore—wherefore, in God’s name, did he woo
me—for woo he did, and fervently and long before
he won me to confession?—oh! he is base!—base,
base, and bad at heart, my sister!—answer me
nothing, dear one, for I will prove him very shortly—send
Margaret hither to array me, I will go speak
with him forthwith—if he be honest, Marian, he is
yours—and think not that I sacrifice myself, when I
say this; for all the love I ever felt for him has
vanished utterly away—if he is honest, he is yours—but
be not over confident, dear child, for I believe he
is not—and if not—why then, sweet Marian, can we
not comfort one another, and live together as we
used, dear, innocent, united happy sisters? Do not
reply now, Marian—your heart is too full—haste and
do as I tell you; before supper time to-night all shall
be ended, whether for good or evil, <span style='font-size:smaller'>HE</span> only knows
to whom the secrets of the heart are visible, e’en as
the features of the face. Farewell—be of good
cheer, and yet not over cheerful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within an hour after that most momentous conversation
Annabel sat beside the window in that fair
summer parlor, looking out on the fair prospect of
mead and dale and river, with its back ground of
purple mountains—the very window from which she
had first looked upon De Vaux. Perhaps a secret
instinct had taught her to select that spot now that
she was about to renounce him forever—but if it
were so, it was one of those indefinable impulsive
instincts of which we are unconscious, even while
they prompt our actions. De Vaux was summoned
to her presence, and Annabel awaited him—arbiter
of her own, her sister’s destinies! “Ernest—” she
said, as he entered, cutting across his eager and impetuous
inquiries, “Ernest De Vaux, I have learned
to-day a secret—” she spoke with perfect ease, and
without a symptom of irritation, or anxiety, or sorrow,
either in her voice, or in her manner—nor was
she cold or dignified, or haughty. Her demeanor
was not indeed that of a fond maid to her accepted
suitor; nor had it the flutter which marks the consciousness
of unacknowledged love—a sister’s to a
dear brother’s would have resembled it more nearly
than perhaps anything to which it could be compared,
yet was not this altogether similar. He looked
up in her face with a smile, and asked at once,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What secret, dearest Annabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A secret, Ernest,” she replied, “which I cannot
but fancy you must have learned <span class='it'>before</span>, but which
<span class='it'>you</span> certainly <span class='it'>have</span> learned, as well as I, to-day. My
sister loves you, Ernest!” The young man’s face
was crimson on the instant, and he would have made
some reply, but his voice failed him, and after a moment
of confused stuttering, he stood before her in
embarrassed silence, but she went on at once, not
noticing apparently his consternation. “If you did
know this, as I fear must be the case, long long ago!
most basely have you acted, and most cruelly, to
both of us—for never! never! even if it had been a
rash and unsought, and unjustifiable passion on her
part, would I have wedded, knowingly, the man who
held my sister’s heart strings!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was,” he answered instantly, “it was a rash
and unsought, and unjustifiable passion on her part—believe
me, oh! believe me, Annabel! that is—that
is—” he continued, reddening again, at feeling himself
self-convicted—“that is—if she felt any passion!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you <span class='it'>did</span> know it—then you <span class='it'>did</span> know it—”
she interrupted him, without paying any regard to his
attempt at self-correction, “then you did know it
from the very first—oh! man! man! oh! false heart
of man—oh! falser tongue that can speak thus of a
woman whom he <span class='it'>loves!</span> yes! <span class='it'>loves!</span>” she added in a
clear high voice, thrilling as the alarm blast of a silver
trumpet—“yes! loves—Ernest De Vaux—with
his whole heart and spirit—never think to deny it—did
I not see you, when you rushed to save her from
a lesser peril, when you left me, as you must have
thought, to perish—did I not see love, written as
clearly as words in a book, on every feature of <span class='it'>your</span>
face—even as I heard love crying out aloud in every
accent of <span class='it'>her</span> voice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! jealous, Annabel? the calm and self-controlling
Annabel! can she be jealous—of her own
sister, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not jealous! sir—” she answered, now most
contemptuously, “not jealous in the least, I do assure
you—for though most surely love <span class='it'>can</span> exist without
one touch of jealousy, as surely cannot jealousy
exist where there is neither love, nor admiration,
nor esteem, nor so much as respect existing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How—do I hear you—” he asked somewhat
sharply—“do I understand you aright? what have
become, then, of your vows and protestations—your
promises of yester even?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do hear me—you do understand me—” she
replied, “entirely aright—entirely! In my heart,
for I have searched it very deeply—in my heart
there is not now one feeling of love, or admiration,
or esteem—much less respect for you, alas! that I
should say so—alas! for me and you—alas! for one,
more to be pitied twenty-fold than either!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Annabel Hawkwood, you have never loved me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ernest De Vaux, you never have known—never
will know—because you are incapable of knowing
the depth, the singleness, the honesty of a true woman’s
love. So deeply did I love you, that I have
come down hither, seeing that long before you knew
<span class='it'>me</span>, you had won Marian’s heart—seeing that you
loved her, as she loves you, most ardently—and
hoping that you had not discovered her affections,
nor suspected your own feelings until to-day—I came
down hither with that knowledge, in that hope—and
had I found that you had erred no further than in
trivial fickleness, loving you all the while beyond all
things on earth, I purposed to resign your hand to
her, thus making both of you happy, and trusting for
my own contentment to consciousness of rights and
to the love of <span style='font-size:smaller'>THEM</span>, who, all praise be to Him
therefore, has constituted so the spirit of Annabel
Hawkwood, that when she cannot honor, she cannot,
afterward forever, feel either love or friendship—you
are weighed, Ernest De Vaux, weighed in the
balance and found wanting—I leave you now, sir, to
prepare my sister to bear the blow your baseness
has inflicted—our marriage is broken off at once,
now and forever—lay all the blame on me!—on
me!—if it so please you—but not one word against
my own or Marian’s honor—my aunt I shall inform
instantly, that for sufficient reasons our promised
union will not take place at all—the reasons I shall
lock in my own bosom. You will remain here—you
<span class='it'>must</span> do so—this one night, to-morrow morning
we will bid you adieu forever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be it so”—he replied—“Be it so, lady—the fickleness
I can forgive—but not the scorn! I will go
now and order that the regiment march hence forthwith,
what more recruits there be can follow at their
leisure—and I will overtake the troops before noon,
on the march, to-morrow,” and with the words he
left the room apparently as unconcerned as if he had
gone thence but for a walk of pleasure, as if he had
not left a breaking heart behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And was it true, that Annabel no longer loved
him? True!—oh believe it not—where woman once
has fixed her soul’s affections there they will dwell
forever—principle may compel her to suppress it—prudence
may force her to conceal it—the fiery sense
of instantaneous wrongs may seem to quench it for a
moment—the bitterness of jealousy may turn it into
gall, but like that Turkish perfume, where love has
once existed it must exist forever, so long as one
fragment of the earthly vessel which contained it survives
the wreck of time and ruin. She believed that
she loved him not—but she knew not herself—what
woman ever did?—what man?—when the spring-tide
of passion was upon them. And she too left the
parlor, and within a few minutes Marian had heard
her fate, and after many a tear, and many a passionate
exclamation, she too apparently was satisfied of
Ernest’s worthlessness—oh! misapplied and heartless
term! She satisfied?—satisfied by the knowledge
that her heart’s idol was an unclean thing—an evil
spirit—a false God!—she satisfied?—oh Heaven!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Around the hospitable board once more—once
more they were assembled—but oh! how sadly
altered—the fiat had been distinctly, audibly pronounced—and
all assembled there had heard—though
none except the sisters and De Vaux knew it—none
probably, but they suspected—well was it that there
were no young men—no brothers with high hearts
and strong hands to maintain, or question—well was
it that the only relatives of those much injured maidens,
the only friends, were superannuated men of
peace; the ministers of pardon, not of vengeance—and
weak old helpless women—there had been
bloodshed else—and as it was, among the serving
men there were dark brows and writhing lips, and
hands alert to grasp the hilt at a word spoken—had
they been of rank one grade higher—had they <span class='it'>dared</span>
even as they were——there had been bloodshed!
Cold, cold and cheerless was the conversation, forward
and dignified civilities in place of gay familiar
mirth, forced smiles for hearty laughter, pale looks
and dim eyes for the glad blushes of the promised
bride—for the bright sparkles of her eye! The
evening passed—the hour of parting came, and it
was colder yet and sadder—Ernest De Vaux, calm
and inscrutable, and seemingly unmoved, kissed the
hands of his lovely hostesses, and uttered his adieu,
and thanks for all their kindness, and hopes for their
prosperity and welfare, while the old clergyman
looked on with dark and angry brows, and the help-mate
with difficulty could refrain from loud and
passionate invective. His lip had a curl upon it,
a painful curl, half smile, half sneer, as he bowed to
the rest and left the parlor, but none observed that as
he did so he spoke three or four words in a low
whisper, so low that it reached Marian’s ear alone
of all that stood around him, yet of such import that
her color came and went ten times within the minute,
and that she shook from head to foot, and quivered
like an aspen. For two hours longer the sisters
sat together in Annabel’s bedchamber, and wept in
one another’s arms, and comforted each other’s sorrows,
and little dreamed that they should meet no
more for years—perchance forever! The morning
broke like that which had preceded it, serene and
bright, and lovely—the great sun rushed up the blue
vault in triumphant splendor, all nature laughed out
his glory—but at a later hour, far later than usual,
no smoke was seen curling from the chimneys of the
hall, no sign of man or beast was visible about its
precincts. The passionate scenes—the wild excitement
of the preceding day, had brought about, as
usual, a dull reaction; and sleep sat heavy on the
eyelids, on the souls of the inmates. The first who
woke up was Annabel—Annabel, the bereaved, the
almost widowed bride. Dressing herself in haste,
she sought, as usual, her mother’s chamber, found
her—oh happy! how happy in her benighted state,
since she knew not, nor understood at all, the sorrows
of those whom she once had loved so tenderly—found
her in deep calm slumber—kissed her brow
silently, and breathed a fond prayer over her, then
hurried thence to Marian’s chamber—the door stood
open; it was vacant! Down the stairs to the garden—the
door that led to that sweet spot was barred
and bolted—the front door stood upon the latch, and
by that Annabel passed out into the fresh young
morning—how fair, how peaceable, how calm was
all around her—how utterly unlike the strife, the toils,
the cares, the sorrows, the hot hatreds of the animated
world—how utterly unlike the anxious pains
which were then gnawing at that fair creature’s
heartstrings! She stood awhile, and gazed around
and listened; but no sound met her ears, except the
oft-heard music of the wind and water—except the
well-known points of that familiar scene—she
walked—she ran—a fresh fear struck her, a fear of
she knew not what—she flew to the garden—“Marian!
Marian!”—but no Marian came! no voice
made answer to her shrill outcries—back! back!
she hurried to the house, but in her way she crossed
the road conducting to the stables—there were fresh
horse tracks—several fresh horse tracks—one which
looked like the print of Marian’s palfrey—without a
moment’s hesitation she rushed into the stable court,
no groom was there, nor stable boy, nor helper—and
yet the door stood open, and a loud tremulous neighing,
Annabel knew it instantly to be the call of her
own jennet, was wakening unanswered echoes.
She stood a moment like a statue before she could
command herself to cross the threshold—she crossed,
and the stall where Marian’s palfrey should
have stood next her own, was vacant. The chargers
of De Vaux were gone; the horses of his followers—she
shrieked aloud—she shrieked till every pinnacle
and turret of the old hall, till every dell and
headland of the hills, sent back a yelling echo. It
scarcely seemed a moment before the court yard,
which, a moment since so silent and deserted, was
full of hurrying men and frightened women—the
news was instantly abroad that mistress Marian had
been spirited away by the false lord. Horses were
saddled instantly, and broadswords girded on, and
men were mounting in hot haste ere Annabel had in
so much recovered from the shock, as to know what
to order, or advise—evil and hasty counsels had been
taken, but the good vicar and the prebendary came
down in time to hinder them. A hurried consultation
was held in the house, and it was speedily determined
that the two clergymen should set forth on the
instant, with a sufficient escort, to pursue, and, if it
should be possible, bring back the fugitive—and
although Annabel at the first was in despair, fancying
that there could be no hope of her being overtaken,
yet was she somewhat reassured on learning
that De Vaux could not quit his regiment, and that
the slow route of a regiment on a long march could
easily be caught up with, even by aged travellers.
The sun was scarce three hours high, when the pursuers
started—all that day long it lagged across the
sky—it set, and was succeeded by night, longer still,
and still more dreary—another day! and yet another!
Oh the slow agony of waiting! the torture of enumerating
minutes—each minute seemingly an age—the
dull, heart-sickening suspense of awaiting tidings—tidings
which the heart tells us—the heart, too
faithful prophet of the future—cannot by possibility
be good; while reason interposes her vain veto to
the heart’s decision, and hope uplifts her false and
siren song. The third night came, and Annabel was
sitting at the same window—how often it occurs that
one spot witnesses <span class='it'>the</span> dozen scenes most interesting,
most eventful to the same individual. Is it that consciousness
of what has passed leads man to the spot
marked by one event when he expects another? or
can it be indeed a destiny? The third night came,
and Annabel was sitting at that same window, when,
on the distant highway, she beheld her friends returning,
but they rode heavily and sadly onwards,
nor was there any flutter of female garbs among
them—Marian was not among them! They came—the
story was soon told—they had succeeded in overtaking
the regiment, they had seen Ernest, and Marian
was <span class='it'>his wife</span>! The register of her marriage,
duly attested, had been shown to her uncle in the
church at Rippon, and though she had refused to see
them, she had sent word that she was well and
happy, with many messages of love and cordiality
to Annabel, and promises that she would write at
short and frequent intervals. No more was to be
done—nothing was said at all. Men marvelled at
De Vaux, and envied him! Women blamed Marian
Hawkwood, and they too envied! But Annabel said
nothing, but went about her daily duties, tending her
helpless mother and answering her endless queries
concerning Marian’s absence, and visiting her pensioners
among the village poor, seemingly cheerful
and contented. But her cheek constantly grew paler,
and her form thinner and less round. The sword
was hourly wearing out the scabbard! The spirit
was too mighty for the vessel that contained it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Five years had passed—five wearisome, long years—years
of domestic strife and civil war, of bloodshed,
conflagration and despair throughout all England.
The party of the king, superior at the first,
was waxing daily weaker, and all was almost lost.
For the first years Marian <span class='it'>did</span> write, and that, too,
frequently and fondly to her sister; never alluding to
the past, and seldom to De Vaux, except to say that
he was all she wished him, and she herself more
happy than she hoped or deserved to be. But gradually
did the letters become less frequent and more
formal; communications were obstructed, and posts
were intercepted, and scarce, at last, did Annabel
hear twice in twelve months of her sister’s welfare.
And when she did hear, the correspondence had become
cold and lifeless; the tone of Marian, too, was
altered, the buoyancy was gone—the mirth—the soul—and
though she complained not, nor hinted that she
was unhappy, yet Annabel saw plainly that it was
so. Saw it, and sorrowed, and said nothing! Thus
time passed on, with all its tides and chances, and
the old paralytic invalid was gathered to her fathers,
and slept beside her husband in the yard of the same
humble church which had beheld their union, and
Annabel was more alone than ever. Thus things
went on until some months after the deadly fight and
desperate defeat at Marston. Autumn had come
again—brown autumn—and Annabel was in her garden
tending her flowers, and listening to her birds,
and thinking of the past, not with the anguish of a
present sorrow, but with the mellowed recollection
of regret. She stood beside the stream—the stream
that, all unchanged itself, had witnessed such sad
changes in all that was around it—close to the spot
where she had talked so long to Marian on that
eventful morning, when a quick, soft step came behind
her—she turned and Marian clasped her!
Forced, after years of sufferance, to fly from the outrageous
cruelty of him for whom she had thrown up
all but honor, she had come home—home, like the
hunted hare to her form, like the wounded bird to
her own nest—she had come home to die. What
boots it to repeat the old and oft-told tale, how eager
passion made way for uncertain and oft interrupted
gleams of fondness—how a love, based on no esteem
or real principle, melted like wax before the fire—how
inattention paved the way for neglect—and infidelity
came close behind—and open profligacy and
insult, and cool, maddening outrage followed. How
the ardent lover became the careless husband, the
cold master, the unfeeling tyrant, and, at last, the
brutal despot. Marian came home to die—the seeds
of that invincible disease were sown deep in her
bosom—her exquisitely rounded shape was angular
and thin, emaciated by disease, and suffering, and
sorrow. A burning hectic spot on either cheek were
now the only remnants of that once all-radiant complexion;
her step so slow and faltering, her breath
drawn sob by sob with actual agony, her quick, short
cough, all told too certainly the truth! Her faults
were punished bitterly on earth, and happily that
punishment had worked its fitting end—these faults
were all repented, were all amended now. Perhaps
at no time of her youthful bloom had Marian been
so sweet, so truly lovely, as now when her young
days were numbered. All the asperity and harshnesses,
the angles as it were of her character, mellowed
down into a calm and unrepining cheerfulness.
And oh! with what delicious tenderness did Annabel
console, and pray with, and caress—oh! they were
indeed happy! indeed happy for those last months,
those lovely sisters. For Annabel’s delight at seeing
the dear Marian of happier and better days once
more beside her in their old chamber, beside her in
the quiet garden, beside her in the pew of the old
village church, had, for the time, completely overpowered
her fears for her sister’s health, and, as is
almost invariably the case in that most fatal, most
insidious of disorders, she constantly was flattered
with vain hopes that her Marian was amending, that
the next spring would see her again well and happy.
Vain hopes! indeed vain hopes—but which of mortal
hopes is other?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cold mists of November were on the hills and
in the glens of Wharfdale, the trees were stripped of
their last leaves, the grass was sere and withered,
the earth cheerless, the skies comfortless, when, at
the same predestined window, the sisters sat watching
the last gleam of the wintry sun fade on the distant
hill tops. What was that flash far up the road?
That sound and ringing report? Another! and another!
the evident reports of musketry. And lo!
a horseman flying—a wild, fierce troop pursuing—the
foremost rides bareheaded, but the blue scarf that
flutters in the air shows him a loyal cavalier; the
steel caps and jack boots of the pursuers point them
out evidently puritans; there are but twenty of them;
and lo! the fugitive gains on them—heaven! he turns
from the highroad, crosses the steep bridge at a gallop,
he takes the park-gate at a leap, he cuts across
the turf, and lo! the dalesmen and the tenants have
mustered to resist; a short, fierce struggle—the
roundheads are beat back—the fugitive, now at the
very hall doors, is preserved. The door flew open,
he staggered into the well-known vestibule, opened
the parlor door with an accustomed hand, and reeled
into the presence of the sisters, exhausted with
fatigue, pale from the loss of blood, faint with his
mortal wounds; yet he spoke out in a clear voice—“In
time, in time, thank God, in time to make some
reparation, to ask for pardon ere I die!” and with
these words De Vaux, for he it was, staggered up to
his injured wife, and, dropping on his knees, cast his
arms round her waist, and burying his head in her
lap, exclaimed in faltering tones—“Pardon me, Marian,
pardon before I die—pardon me as you loved
me once!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! as I love you now, dear Ernest,
fully, completely, gladly, do I pardon you, and take
you to my heart, never again to part, my own dear
husband.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>Annabel saw her head fall on his neck, and, fancying
that she had fainted, ran to relieve her, but ere she
did so both were far away beyond the reach of any
mortal sorrow—nor did the survivor long survive
them—she faded like a fair flower, and lies beside
them in the still bosom of one common tomb. The
Hall was tenanted no more, and soon fell into ruin,
but the wild hills of Wharfdale must themselves pass
away before the children of the dalesmen shall forget
the sad tale of <span class='sc'>The Sisters</span>.</p>

<p class='line0'>We hear the near quail, from the rye stubble, call,</p>
<p class='line0'>And we watch the black beetle on rolling his ball;</p>
<p class='line0'>Then forward again, with new strength, on our way,</p>
<p class='line0'>Our footsteps as light as our bosoms are gay,</p>
<p class='line0'>A whirr—and, so sudden, the heart gives a bound,</p>
<p class='line0'>The partridge bursts up from his basin of ground;</p>
<p class='line0'>Three clear, fife-like notes—first, a low, liquid strain,</p>
<p class='line0'>Then high, and then shrill—all repeated again,</p>
<p class='line0'>’Tis the brown-thresher, perch’d on yon pine grim and dark,</p>
<p class='line0'>Our sweetest of minstrels—our own native lark.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;We pass the low sawmill—the bridge o’er the brook,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where it glides, slow and deep, by each alder-cloth’d nook,</p>
<p class='line0'>We toil up the hill—o’er the fields are the frames</p>
<p class='line0'>Of hemlocks, scath’d black by the fierce fallow-flames,</p>
<p class='line0'>Or girdled, with half naked trunks smooth and gray,</p>
<p class='line0'>To catch the red lightning, or sink in decay.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Again the wood closes—still wend we along,</p>
<p class='line0'>The robin is cheering our hearts with his song,</p>
<p class='line0'>The black snake, warm basking, his sunlight forsakes,</p>
<p class='line0'>As, at the loud beat of our steps, he awakes,</p>
<p class='line0'>The trees shrink away—one more hill to our feet,</p>
<p class='line0'>And our eyes, Pleasant Pond, in its beauty will greet;</p>
<p class='line0'>There glitters the outlet—still, upward, we pass,</p>
<p class='line0'>And there, spreads its smooth polish’d bosom of glass.</p>
<p class='line0'>On the East, lifts a hill, low and rounded, its crown</p>
<p class='line0'>With a slope, like a robe, on each side falling down,</p>
<p class='line0'>All verdant with meadow, and bristling with grain,</p>
<p class='line0'>From its top, to the edge of the bright liquid plain,</p>
<p class='line0'>Thence the banks, sweeping round to the North and the West,</p>
<p class='line0'>With clearing and field interspersed on their breast,</p>
<p class='line0'>Are lost in the black frowning gloom of the wood</p>
<p class='line0'>That hides, with its shadows, the Southernmost flood.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;How quiet, how peaceful, how lovely, the scene!</p>
<p class='line0'>The glossy black shades, from yon headlands of green,</p>
<p class='line0'>That sheet of bright crystal, which spreads from the shore,</p>
<p class='line0'>Now dark’ning, as lightly the breeze tramples o’er,</p>
<p class='line0'>Those shafts of quick splendor—these dazzles of light⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>So painful, so blinding, eyes shrink from the sight;</p>
<p class='line0'>And still, to our fix’d gaze, new colors reveal,</p>
<p class='line0'>Here, gleaming like silver—there, flashing like steel.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;We hear, in the stillness, the low of the herd,</p>
<p class='line0'>The sound of the sheep-bell, the chirp of the bird,</p>
<p class='line0'>All borne from the opposite border—and hark!</p>
<p class='line0'>How the echoes long mimic the dog’s rapid bark!</p>
<p class='line0'>See that white gleaming streak—’tis the wake of the loon</p>
<p class='line0'>As she oars her swift passage—her dive will be soon;</p>
<p class='line0'>She’s vanish’d—but upward again to the sight,</p>
<p class='line0'>Her dappled back lit by a pencil of light,</p>
<p class='line0'>But the bark has arous’d her—she’s seeking to fly;</p>
<p class='line0'>She stretches her neck, with shrill, tremulous cry,</p>
<p class='line0'>She flounders in low heavy circles just o’er,</p>
<p class='line0'>Till nerv’d by the loud hostile sounds from the shore</p>
<p class='line0'>Uprising, she shoots, like a dart, to her brood</p>
<p class='line0'>Close hid in the water-plants edging the wood.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;On this lap of green grass, the white cloth is display’d,</p>
<p class='line0'>A maple sheds over its golden streak’d shade,</p>
<p class='line0'>We place cup and trencher—the viands are spread,</p>
<p class='line0'>Whilst a pile of pine-knots flame a pillar of red,</p>
<p class='line0'>We slice the rich lemon—the gifts of the spring</p>
<p class='line0'>Bubbling up in its gray sandy basin, we bring</p>
<p class='line0'>The white glistening sugar—the butter, like gold,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the fruits of the garden, our baskets unfold,</p>
<p class='line0'>The raspberry bowl-shap’d—the jet tiny cone</p>
<p class='line0'>Or the blackberry, pluck’d from the thickets are strown,</p>
<p class='line0'>All grace the grass-table—our cups mantle free</p>
<p class='line0'>With the dark purple coffee, and light amber tea,</p>
<p class='line0'>Wood, water, and bank tongue the laugh, and the jest,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the goddess or mirth reigns supreme in each breast.</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The sunset is slanting—a pyramid bright</p>
<p class='line0'>Is traced on the waters, in spangles of light;</p>
<p class='line0'>A grey blending glimmer then steals like a pall;</p>
<p class='line0'>Gold, leaves hill and tree-top—brown, deepens o’er all;</p>
<p class='line0'>The bat wheels around—sends the nighthawk his cry,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the cross-bill commences her sweet lullaby;</p>
<p class='line0'>In the grass chirps the cricket—the tree-toad crows shrill,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the bark of the watch-dog sounds faint from the hill.</p>
<p class='line0'>We smile at the hoarse heav’d-up roar of the frog,</p>
<p class='line0'>And his half smother’d gulp as he dives from his log,</p>
<p class='line0'>And then hasten homeward, fatigu’d, but still gay,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure that’s <span class='sc'>The Flame</span> over by the
shore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cer<span class='it'>ting</span>, manny! I could tell her pipes acrost the
Mazoura.”<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you will overhaul her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t we though! I tell ye, Stranger, so sure
as my name’s Ben Blower, that that last tar bar’l I
hove in the furnace has put jist the smart chance of
go-ahead into us to cut off The Flame from yonder
pint, or send our boat to kingdom come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil!” exclaimed a bystander who, intensely
interested in the race, was leaning the while
against the partitions of the boiler-room, “I’ve chosen
a nice place to see the fun near this infernal powder
barrel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so bad as if you were in it!” coolly observed
Ben, as the other walked rapidly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As if he were in it! in what? in the boiler?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cer<span class='it'>ting</span>! Don’t folks sometimes go into bilers,
manny?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think there’d be other parts of the boat

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right; poking fun at me at once’t; but
wait till we get through this brush with the old Flame
and I’ll tell ye of a regular fixin scrape that a man
may get into. It’s true, too, every word of it—as
sure as my name’s Ben Blower.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have seen the Flame then afore, Stranger?
Six year ago, when new upon the river, she was a
real out and outer, I tell ye. I was at that time a
hand aboard of her. Yes, I belonged to her at the
time of her great race with the ‘G<span class='it'>o</span>-liar.’ You’ve
heern, mayhap, of the blow-up by which we lost it?
They made a great fuss about it; but it was nothing
but a mere fiz of hot water after all. Only the springing
of a few rivets, which loosened a biler plate or
two, and let out a thin spirting upon some niggers
that hadn’t sense enough to get out of the way. Well,
the ‘G<span class='it'>o</span>-liar’ took off our passengers, and we ran
into Smasher’s Landing to repair damages, and bury
the poor fools that were killed. Here we laid for a
matter of thirty hours or so, and got things to rights
on board for a bran new start. There was some
carpenter’s work yet to be done, but the captain said
that that might be fixed off jist as well when we were
under way—we had worked hard—the weather was
sour, and we needn’t do any thing more jist now—we
might take that afternoon to ourselves, but the
next morning he’d get up steam bright and airly,
and we’d all come out <span class='it'>new</span>. There was no temperance
society at Smasher’s Landing, and I went
ashore upon a lark with some of the hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I omit the worthy Benjamin’s adventures upon land,
and, despairing of fully conveying his language in
its original Doric force, will not hesitate to give the
rest of his singular narrative in my own words, save
where, in a few instances, I can recall his precise
phraseology, which the reader will easily recognize.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The night was raw and sleety when I regained
the deck of our boat. The officers, instead of leaving
a watch above, had closed up every thing, and shut
themselves in the cabin. The fire-room only was
open. The boards dashed from the outside by the
explosion had not yet been replaced. The floor of
the room was wet and there was scarcely a corner
which afforded a shelter from the driving storm. I
was about leaving the room, resigned to sleep in the
open air, and now bent only upon getting under the
lee of some bulkhead that would protect me against
the wind. In passing out I kept my arms stretched
forward to feel my way in the dark, but my feet came
in contact with a heavy iron lid; I stumbled, and, as
I fell, struck one of my hands into the ‘manhole,’
(I think this was the name he gave to the oval-shaped
opening in the head of the boiler,) through
which the smith had entered to make his repairs. I
fell with my arm thrust so far into the aperture that I
received a pretty smart blow in the face as it came
in contact with the head of the boiler, and I did not
hesitate to drag my body after it, the moment I recovered
from this stunning effect and ascertained my
whereabouts. In a word, I crept into the boiler resolved
to pass the rest of the night there. The place
was dry and sheltered. Had my bed been softer, I
would have had all that man could desire; as it was,
I slept and slept soundly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should mention though, that, before closing my
eyes, I several times shifted my position. I had gone
first to the farther end of the boiler, then again I had
crawled back to the manhole, to put my hand out
and feel that it was really still open. The warmest
place was at the farther end, where I finally established
myself, and that I knew from the first. It
was foolish in me to think that the opening through
which I had just entered could be closed without my
hearing it, and that, too, when no one was astir but
myself; but the blow on the side of my face made
me a little nervous perhaps; besides, I never could
bear to be shut up in any place—it always gives a
wild-like feeling about the head. You may laugh,
Stranger, but I believe I should suffocate in an empty
church, if I once felt that I was so shut up in it that
I could not get out. I have met men afore now just
like me, or worse rather—much worse. Men that
it made sort of furious to be tied down to anything,
yet so soft-like and contradictory in their natures that
you might lead them anywhere so long as they
didn’t feel the string. Stranger, it takes all sorts of
people to make a world! and we may have a good
many of the worst kind of white-men here out west.
But I have seen folks upon this river—quiet looking
chaps, too, as ever you see—who were so teetotally
<span class='it'>carankterakterous</span> that they’d shoot the doctor
who’d tell them they couldn’t live when ailing,
and make a die of it, just out of spite, when told
they <span class='it'>must</span> get well. Yes, fellows as fond of the good
things of earth as you or I, yet who’d rush like mad
right over the gang-plank of life, if once brought to
believe that they had to stay in this world whether
they wanted to leave it or not. Thunder and bees!
if such a fellow as that had heard the cocks crow as
I did—awakened to find darkness about him—darkness
so thick you might cut it with a knife—heard
other sounds, too, to tell that it was morning, and
scrambling to fumble for that manhole, found it, too,
black—closed—black and even as the rest of the iron
coffin around him, closed, with not a rivet-hole to let
God’s light and air in—why—why—he’d ’a <span class='it'>swounded</span>
right down on the spot, as I did, and I ain’t
ashamed to own it to no white-man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big drops actually stood upon the poor fellow’s
brow, as he now paused for a moment in the recital
of his terrible story. He passed his hand over his
rough features, and resumed it with less agitation of
manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long I may have remained there senseless
I don’t know. The doctors have since told me it
must have been a sort of fit—more like an apoplexy
than a swoon, for the attack finally passed off in sleep—Yes
I slept, I know <span class='it'>that</span>, for I dreamed—dreamed
a heap o’ things afore I awoke—there is but one
dream, however, that I have ever been able to recall
distinctly, and that must have come on shortly before
I recovered my consciousness. My resting place
through the night had been, as I have told you, at the
far end of the boiler. Well, I now dreamed that the
manhole was still open—and, what seems curious,
rather than laughable, if you take it in connection
with other things, I fancied that my legs had been
so stretched in the long walk I had taken the evening
before, that they now reached the whole length of
the boiler and extended through the opening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At first, (in my dreaming reflections) it was a
comfortable thought that no one could now shut up
the manhole without awakening me. But soon it
seemed as if my feet, which were on the outside,
were becoming drenched in the storm which had
originally driven me to seek this shelter. I felt the
chilling rain upon my extremities. They grew colder
and colder, and their numbness gradually extended
upward to other parts of my body. It seemed, however,
that it was only the under side of my person
that was thus strangely visited. I laid upon my
back, and it must have been a species of nightmare
that afflicted me, for I knew at last that I was dreaming,
yet felt it impossible to rouse myself. A violent
fit of coughing restored, at last, my powers of volition.
The water, which had been slowly rising
around me, had rushed into my mouth; I awoke to
hear the rapid strokes of the pump which was driving
it into the boiler!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My whole condition—no—not all of it—not yet—my
<span class='it'>present</span> condition flashed with new horror upon
me. But I did not again swoon. The choking sensation
which had made me faint, when I first discovered
how I was entombed, gave way to a livelier, though
less overpowering, emotion. I shrieked even as I
started from my slumber. The previous discovery
of the closed aperture, with the instant oblivion that
followed, seemed only a part of my dream, and I
threw my arms about and looked eagerly for the
opening by which I had entered the horrid place—yes,
looked for it, and felt for it, though it was the
terrible conviction that it was closed—a second time
brought home to me—which prompted my frenzied
cry. Every sense seemed to have tenfold acuteness,
yet not one to act in unison with another. I shrieked
again and again—imploringly—desperately—savagely.
I filled the hollow chamber with my cries till its
iron walls seemed to tingle around me. The dull
strokes of the accursed pump seemed only to mock
at while they deadened my screams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last I gave myself up. It is the struggle against
our fate which frenzies the mind. We cease to fear
when we cease to hope. I gave myself up and then
I grew calm!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was resigned to die—resigned even to my mode
of death. It was not, I thought, so very new after all
as to awaken unwonted horror in a man. Thousands
have been sunk to the bottom of the ocean shut up in
the holds of vessels—beating themselves against the
battened hatches—dragged down from the upper world
shrieking, not for life but for death only beneath the
eye and amid the breath of heaven. Thousands have
endured that appalling kind of suffocation. I would
die only as many a better man had died before me.
I <span class='it'>could</span> meet such a death. I said so—I thought so—I
felt so—felt so, I mean, for a minute—or more; ten
minutes it may have been—or but an instant of time.
I know not—nor does it matter if I could compute it.
There <span class='it'>was</span> a time then when I was resigned to my
fate. But, good God! was I resigned to it in the
shape in which next it came to appal? Stranger, I
felt that water growing hot about my limbs, though
it was yet mid-leg deep. I felt it, and, in the same
moment, heard the roar of the furnace that was to
turn it into steam before it could get deep enough to
drown one!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shudder—It <span class='it'>was</span> hideous. But did I shrink
and shrivel, and crumble down upon that iron floor,
and lose my senses in that horrid agony of fear?—No!—though
my brain swam and the life-blood that
curdled at my heart seemed about to stagnate there
forever, still <span class='it'>I knew!</span> I was too hoarse—too hopeless,
from my previous efforts, to cry out more. But
I struck—feebly at first, and then strongly—frantically
with my clenched fist against the sides of the
boiler. There were people moving near who <span class='it'>must</span>
hear my blows! Could not I hear the grating of
chains, the shuffling of feet, the very rustle of a rope,
hear them all, within a few inches of me? I did—but
the gurgling water that was growing hotter and
hotter around my extremities, made more noise
within the steaming caldron than did my frenzied
blows against its sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Latterly I had hardly changed my position, but
now the growing heat of the water made me plash
to and fro; lifting myself wholly out of it was impossible,
but I could not remain quiet. I stumbled upon
something—it was a mallet!—a chance tool the smith
had led there by accident. With what wild joy did
I seize it—with what eager confidence did I now
deal my first blows with it against the walls of my
prison! But scarce had I intermitted them for a
moment when I heard the clang of the iron door as
the fireman flung it wide to feed the flames that were
to torture me. My knocking was unheard, though I
could hear him toss the sticks into the furnace beneath
me, and drive to the door when his infernal
oven was fully crammed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had I yet a hope? I had, but it rose in my
mind side by side with the fear that I might now
become the agent of preparing myself a more frightful
death—Yes! when I thought of that furnace with
its fresh-fed flames curling beneath the iron upon
which I stood—a more frightful death even than that
of being boiled alive! Had I discovered that mallet
but a short time sooner—but no matter, I would by
its aid resort to the only expedient now left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was this—I remembered having a marline-spike
in my pocket, and in less time than I have taken in
hinting at the consequences of thus using it, I had
made an impression upon the sides of the boiler, and
soon succeeded in driving it through. The water
gushed through the aperture—would they see it?—No,
the jet could only play against a wooden partition
which must hide the stream from view—it must
trickle down upon the decks before the leakage
would be discovered. Should I drive another hole
to make that leakage greater? Why, the water
within seemed already to be sensibly diminished—so
hot had become that which remained—should more
escape, would I not hear it bubble and hiss upon the
fiery plates of iron that were already scorching the
soles of my feet?</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:0.5em;margin-bottom:0.5em;'>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• </p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! there is a movement—voices—I hear them
calling for a crowbar—The bulkhead cracks as they
pry off the planking. They have seen the leak—they
are trying to get at it!—Good God! why do they
not first dampen the fire?—Why do they call for the—the⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stranger, look at that finger! it can never regain
its natural size—but it has already done all the service
that man could expect from so humble a member—<span class='it'>Sir,
that hole would have been plugged up on
the instant</span>, unless <span class='it'>I had jammed my finger through</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard the cry of horror as they saw it without—the
shout to drown the fire—the first stroke of the
cold water pump. They say, too, that I was conscious
when they took me out—but I—I remember
nothing more till they brought a julep to my bed-side
arterwards, <span class='sc'>And</span> <span class='it'>that julep!</span>⁠—”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A TALE OF RICHELIEU.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “HENRI QUATRE; OR THE DAYS OF THE LEAGUE.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'>(Continued from page 68.)</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>De Pontis was now despairing—it was evident
Richelieu was in the highest displeasure at the disposal
of the <span class='it'>droit d’aubaine</span> without his knowledge—the
cardinal’s seal was affixed to the ware-rooms,
from which there had been removed only the royal
present, and a few articles of minor value; and the
king had at best but a negative power in protecting
his old servant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The minister returned to Paris, and the veteran
made two ineffectual attempts to gain another audience.
“Ah! my old friend the Sieur De Pontis!”
or the ominous “<span class='it'>serviteur très-humble!</span>” was all he
gained by placing himself in the path of a man before
whom the bravest quailed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old campaigner, he would not abandon the contest;
the royal word had been pledged that it would
stand by the royal act; so Monsieur merely changed
his tactics, acting on the defensive, and awaiting the
issue with calmness; whilst Marguerite trembled
and wept the day long, expecting each hour to see
her father dragged to the Bastille.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By chance rather than prudential dictates, he had
removed several of the account-books of the deceased
Spaniard, ere the cardinal’s seal was affixed.
This trifling act—at least so deemed by the soldier—was,
in the sequel, of much import.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a delay of several days, in which De Pontis
could learn no tidings of the minister’s intentions—and
a visit to the Tuileries, he was well aware,
would compromise his majesty without forwarding
the object in view—he received a citation from the
<span class='it'>Cour Royale</span> to accompany its officers in an inspection
of the ware-rooms. Obeying the summons, an
inventory of the goods was taken, and which was
found to tally with the stock-book, with the exception
of the rich bed and hangings sent to the Tuileries,
and the articles taken to his own use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next day came a legal document from another
of the parliamentary courts of justice, by which it
appeared that a suit had been commenced against
De Pontis, by one Pedro Olivera, claiming to be the
creditor of the deceased to a very large amount—indeed,
to such an extent that, by appraisement of the
inventory, including the debts owing the deceased at
the time of his death, and deducting what amounts
were due to creditors of the estate, so far from being
a wealthy man he died insolvent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In consternation, De Pontis carried his papers as
well as the Spaniard’s books to an advocate, a distant
kinsman. The advocate shook his head ominously
at the recital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Having possessed himself of the effects,” said
the lawyer, “Monsieur has made himself responsible
for the debts of the deceased. And that portion of
the estate which has travelled to the <span class='it'>Palais</span> cannot
of course be recovered—so that he cannot even put
affairs in the posture in which they stood at the time
of the Spaniard’s death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking cautiously round the office, opening the
door, to make certain there were no eaves-droppers,
he shut it again, and approaching the ear of his kinsman,
said in a low tone—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not how to trust even the very walls with
my voice! Without doubt, Monsieur De Pontis, the
claim is a fabrication—at least I cannot believe the
deceased could owe such an amount, nor that this
Olivera was in a condition to trust him. I will examine
these books carefully, and, meantime, respond
to the suit in the usual course. I will not desert a
kinsman, even though he be in the toils of the tyrant.
Farewell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same day, De Pontis was arrested on the plea
of having fraudulently appropriated the property before
ascertaining the amount of the deceased’s debts,
and providing for the same. There had, of course,
been no time for the court to grant any decree in Olivera’s
suit. The arrest was dated from the <span class='it'>Cour
Royale</span>, a distinct court from that in which Pedro’s
suit originated—he being charged by the <span class='it'>procureur-général</span>—the
attorney-general of France—with having
made away with effects which of right belonged
to the estate. He was thus, at the same time, charged
by an officer of the crown in the <span class='it'>Cour Royale</span> with
a penal offence, and sued in a civil court for restitution
by a private creditor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lodged in the <span class='it'>Conciergerie du Palais</span>, it was intimated
that the only chance of release was by finding
surety to the amount of property abstracted. And
how could he do that? The bed and hangings alone
were estimated at the value of two hundred thousand
livres, and had been made for the kinswoman of
Louis, now the wife of Charles the First of England,
who was obliged to countermand the luxurious article,
on account of the troubles which had broken out
in that kingdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus our poor veteran was indeed, as the
advocate Giraud truly affirmed, in the toils of Richelieu,
who held all the strings of government and
justice in his own hands, and could guide them as he
wished. Deprived of the opportunity of self-exertion,
restricted in intercourse with the advocate, his affairs
might have fallen into irretrievable ruin but for the
courage and energy of the fair Marguerite. In the
first paroxysm of despair, she had solicited the boon
of sharing the confinement of De Pontis—this was
refused. Her next application was made to the king,
throwing herself at his feet as he was about proceeding
to mass, and asking permission to attend
her father daily, as she was not permitted to make
the <span class='it'>Conciergerie</span> her home. Louis said aloud, that
the request ought to be made through the proper
channel, at the bureau of the Cardinal Richelieu, and
recommended her to make the appeal—and that it
would be time enough for the royal clemency to interfere
when ordinary means had failed. Such was
the sole answer it was supposed she departed with—but
under pretence of raising the maiden, for she
had thrown herself on her knees, he whispered a
few words of comfort—that he would not abandon
her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The terror in which the cardinal was held was so
great, his power exercised so arbitrarily, that in this
extremity Marguerite was almost friendless. They
looked on the father as a doomed man, and condemned
his rashness—the daughter they pitied, but
shrank from offering her aid. There was one exception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Returning to the lodging in the <span class='it'>Rue St. Denis</span>,
she found Monsieur Giraud waiting her arrival. He
had heard from the lips of their old domestic, of the
maiden’s intention to throw herself at the king’s feet,
and anxiously awaited the issue. Gently chiding
Mademoiselle for not putting confidence in her
father’s friend, he offered to accompany her on the
morrow to the abode of his eminence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The application was successful, and as they returned
from the <span class='it'>Palais Cardinal</span>, the magnificent
abode of the prelate, with an order permitting Mademoiselle
ingress and egress, from morn till eve, to
and from the <span class='it'>Conciergerie</span>, the advocate expressed
a conviction that the king had kept his word, for it
was an unusual privilege.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little of importance transpired in the affairs of De
Pontis till the day previous to that in which we introduced
to the reader our heroine, waiting admission
at the portal of the <span class='it'>Conciergerie</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morn there was a consultation in the prisoner’s
chamber, between the advocate, who had obtained
an order from the bureau for that purpose, and
father and daughter. The worthy Giraud was desponding—the
civil suit, he said, thanks to the dilatoriness
of the courts! was creeping slowly enough,
though much faster than the ordinary routine of practice;
but the <span class='it'>procureur-général</span> had hastened the
penal suit, driving it through the court at such a race-horse
speed, that there was great danger of his obtaining
a decree of sequestration—utterly ruinous to
De Pontis—unless an appeal to cardinal or king,
praying for sufficient delay to prepare a defence,
were resorted to. It was useless applying to the
presidents of the court—they were too much under
the lash of Richelieu to do justice to the respondent
in the suit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far as the Spaniard’s books and accounts, which
De Pontis had preserved, testified, there was no appearance
of such a debt, nothing tending to confirm
directly or indirectly Pedro Olivera’s assumption,
but much negative evidence to prove the falsity of
his claim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was certain, continued the advocate, that a
favorite of the cardinal was laying strong claim to
the <span class='it'>droit d’aubaine</span>, and urging his patron to recover
it. He had himself been informed that the party now
applying such a pressure on his eminence to effect
this unjustifiable, unworthy purpose, had long had an
eye on the alien, and marked the property as his
own. But the name of the individual intimated
in this whisper of scandal, which floated about the
precincts of the courts, was unknown to Giraud, nor
had he the necessary influence to procure it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What matters the name of the minion if they are
bent on ruining me?” exclaimed De Pontis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much!” replied his friend, “but listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The advocate then proceeded to relate that among
the papers of the deceased he found much correspondence
of a peculiar character, some portion of
which might even implicate individuals in a charge
of treason—other portions related to financial matters,
and showing that the Spaniard had been a
lender rather than a borrower, and had supplied parties
connected with the court with money. Much
curious matter there was, even relating to this Pedro
Olivera, who, however, figured in a subordinate
capacity, certainly very different from what might
be expected of one who could lend such a vast sum
of money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have my suspicions,” answered Monsieur Giraud,
“and if we could but discover the party whom
the <span class='it'>droit</span> is intended for, I think I could find a shaft
in the Spaniard’s budget which would pierce him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if I could find the party whom the <span class='it'>droit</span> is
intended for,” exclaimed the veteran, “and had him
before me at rapier’s length in the <span class='it'>pré aux clercs</span>, he
would soon have to enter his cause in another court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no doubt if steel would do the business
my agency would be useless,” rejoined the lawyer,
“but the Sieur De Pontis must remember he is now
on the brink of total ruin, perhaps even of personal
disgrace—that the net is spread on every side—if he
retain the <span class='it'>droit d’aubaine</span>, this Pedro may recover a
decree against him for more than the <span class='it'>droit</span> is worth—if
Pedro by any chance is defeated, the <span class='it'>procureur</span>
catches my friend on the penal suit, and sequesters
<span class='it'>droit</span>, land and everything he has—and adds to it,
most likely, imprisonment. All this may be effected
without causing our generous king to violate his
word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mort de ma vie!</span>” exclaimed De Pontis, starting
up in a rage, “and is not all this done, Monsieur
Giraud, to make an old soldier surrender the king’s
bounty? If I thrust this morsel of paper,” displaying
the sovereign’s sign-manual, “in the fire to boil
our coffee, would not the gates open at once—aye!
and Pedro’s debt vanish like smoke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They would be glad to make such terms, undoubtedly,”
replied the advocate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, by St. Louis and all the saints!” exclaimed
the <span class='it'>militaire</span>, raising his arm and letting the
clenched fist drop on the board with a bound which
did much damage to the breakfast service, “so long
as his gracious majesty promises not to abandon his
old servant, so long will I resist all the priests and
cardinals in France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And will end your days in the Bastille,” uttered
Giraud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! no!” cried Marguerite, bursting into tears,
“Father! Monsieur Giraud! I will go to the cardinal
this morning, and implore him to stay the <span class='it'>procureur’s</span>
proceedings till we can prepare our defence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea pleased the advocate much. There was
but little refinement or delicacy of feeling in his nature—but
he possessed warmth and generosity, and
overlooking the trials, and perhaps insults, which a
female may undergo in seeking such an audience, he
thought good might accrue to the family from the
attempt. It was of pressing moment that the <span class='it'>procureur</span>
should not yet obtain the decree, and no scheme
be abandoned which promised to obtain such a result.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if Mademoiselle could but obtain an audience
of the king, his majesty might know the party
whom the cardinal is fighting so hard for,” added the
lawyer, “and then I may perhaps spring a mine
which will make some people tremble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what do you take my daughter for?”
cried the old soldier; “Can she change her sex?
You will next wish her to plead in court!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She may drag you from ruin, which you would
never have saved yourself from,” replied the advocate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Monsieur Giraud,” said Marguerite, in a
livelier tone than she had for a length of time assumed,
“as you have spoken so flatteringly of me,
allow me to compliment you on your sagacity. I
think there is much truth in what you hint about the
unfortunate Spaniard’s papers. Since my father has
been in prison, our lodging has been searched and
every thing in the shape of written paper examined.
It strikes me that the documents which you possess
have been missed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this is the first word I have heard of it!”
cried De Pontis, darting an angry glance at Marguerite.
“What, another search? They ransacked
our lodging when they took me—and I could not
have believed they would trouble my house again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not wish to distress you, father,” said the
maiden, deprecating the resentment expressed in his
looks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle was quite right,” said the advocate,
“but she ought to have acquainted me with
the fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought it an ordinary proceeding, and was prepared
for such visits,” remarked the damsel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You alarm me,” said Giraud, “they will visit me
next. I must go home and make all secure. I will
then escort Mademoiselle to the <span class='it'>Palais Cardinal</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some further remarks, the advocate, accompanied
by Marguerite, left the apartment of the prisoner,
who muttered to himself as they closed the
door—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Giraud is a stanch, bold man and a true
friend, but he has not as much delicacy and regard
for a lady’s feelings as my hack <span class='it'>Millefleurs</span> could
boast of. I taught the brute to kneel when my poor
wife touched his bridle, and he was quiet as a lamb
when he carried her. Hang all scoundrels, and
may purgatory have the scarlet ones! They fastened
on me when I was young, and they are now sucking
the blood of my old age. Not so old, though—not so
old, but I could pin that scarlet-robed priest to a
tree!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have now brought the history of De Pontis to
that period when Marguerite, having left the prison
with the intention of seeking an interview with
Richelieu, to stay the proceedings of the <span class='it'>procureur</span>,
so indecently hurried through the courts, did not repair
till the following morn to the <span class='it'>Conciergerie</span> to report
her want of success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was, indeed, no hope yet, as she had remarked
so despondingly to her father. Nearly the
whole day had she spent in a waiting-room of the
<span class='it'>Palais Cardinal</span>, flattered with the expectation held
out by the secretaries, that the cardinal would be
visible when the important affairs of state were
despatched; but, to her infinite grief, there came at
length an official to say there would be no audience
that day, for his eminence was sent for in a hurry to
repair to the Tuileries. Giraud was distracted with
the intelligence—he plainly foresaw the predetermined
ruin of the veteran, and advised the damsel to
throw herself once more at the feet of Louis—it was
her only resource.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite, in her lone chamber that night, prayed
to the Holy Virgin for help—for strength to undergo
the trials which awaited her—for fortitude to bear
up against the contumely and rebuffs to which she
was exposed. She prayed not to be relieved of the
task, but for energy to meet it. From whatever
source came the confidence, there was a secret
prompting of the heart, urging her to persevere.
Her father had been ever unlucky so long as his
affairs were under his own management. Why
should there not be a change when he was bereft of
the power either to mend or mar his fortunes?
His destiny in other hands, perhaps that would be
vouchsafed to the daughter which was denied the
parent. These might be fancies, but they lulled her
to a quiet repose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what must be done,” said De Pontis, “with
the <span class='it'>procureur</span>? It is hard that a king’s servant, in
the name of his master, should be employed to oppress
a king’s servant, against the royal inclination.
What does Giraud mean to do now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave all to me,” replied Marguerite, with a
smile. “I am making great proficiency in my new
profession—and though I am very wretched and
heart-broken at times—yet I feel a strange courage.
But you must not expect to see me before to-morrow
morning, for there is much to be done to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Affairs were in that state, that the veteran himself
was a cipher—he felt it, and made no reply. His
daughter soon after left the prison, and De Pontis
had to struggle with the terrible <span class='it'>ennui</span> of the solitary
chamber, and the deprivation of the usual means of
passing the hours.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The advocate’s opinion was in favor of Marguerite
once more approaching the monarch; further
application to Richelieu he deemed useless—not so
the maiden. She resolved to make another appeal
to the cardinal—it might be as was affirmed, that he
had intended to hear her suit, and been summoned
unexpectedly to the Tuileries; and if so, would it
not be an exhibition of contempt to the minister, to
fly to the king, before she could possibly know
whether her prayer would be refused or granted at
the <span class='it'>Palais Cardinal</span>? Thus reasoned Marguerite De
Pontis, and we think not unwisely. The zealous
advocate looked only at conclusions; he judged unfavorably
of the minister’s clemency, and his hopes
instantly pointed to another quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behold her once more on the way to the cardinal’s
palace, in the <span class='it'>Rue St. Honoré</span>! It was the earliest
hour at which his eminence gave audience, yet were
the ante-chambers of the minister filling rapidly. Ascending
the grand staircase, herself, “the observed
of many observers,” yet shrinking from the gaze her
beauty attracted, the door above was opened by an
usher, and she entered a chamber, the first of a long
suite which terminated with the cardinal’s reception-room
and closet of audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The modes of approaching the minister were various,
according to the rank and mission of the visiter.
Strangers of humble quality, and others who, either
through timidity or other cause, judged that they
would not be permitted the <span class='it'>entrée</span> of the reception-room,
or who dare not venture so far, loitered in the
more distant saloons till the illustrious man, issuing
forth to pay respects to majesty, gave opportunity for
a moment’s audience or parley, or presentation of
petition. The individuals of the privileged class
who rejoiced in free access to the reception-chamber,
watched narrowly each opening of the closet-door,
that they might catch the eye of the prelate on
his entry; whilst deeper anxiety was visible in the
countenances of those who had requested audience
through the agency of the gentleman-usher stationed
at the door. The private interviews terminated,
Monseigneur stepped forth, and tarried awhile in the
reception-room, bestowing a bow on one, a nod to
another, and making a third happy—and the envied
of the chamber—by six or more significant words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As all the executive power centred in Richelieu, it
could not happen otherwise, but that suppliants and
petitioners were numerous, and from all parts of the
kingdom, and that among the number should be many
of the fair sex. The <span class='it'>politesse</span> of the court permitted
not such guests to be kept waiting exposed to the
observation of the frequenters of the levee. The
ladies were ushered into the secretary’s apartment,
and that functionary having taken note of their object
or petition, carried the same to Monseigneur to receive
his commands thereon. If, as too often happened
with one whose shoulders bore the burthen
of the state, and who was appealed to at the same
time by an envoy from Turkey claiming alliance,
and by some poor widow or orphan from the Pyrenees
with a tale of wrong—there was any delay in
granting an interview, or giving a decision on the
merits of the case, the fair suppliant was delegated
to a waiting-room to attend the minister’s leisure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here sat, for many tedious hours on the former
occasion, our heroine Marguerite—and as she now
stated her name and object to the usher whose duty
it was to conduct her to the secretary, she vainly
endeavored to decipher a chance of better fortune in
the impassive countenance of the official, as though
it were possible his face would reflect a ray or
emanation of the master’s will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiting-room was again her sad lot—the cardinal
was busily engaged with a German plenipotentiary—but
the audience, as the secretary assured her,
with a smile, could not last forever. It was but to ask
for delay in the prosecution of the penal suit in the
<span class='it'>Cour Royale</span>, that her father might prepare his defence,
and prove the innocence of his intentions. It
was not even necessary that she should see his eminence—one
word to the <span class='it'>procureur</span> would oblige him
to this act of justice—he was the servant of the king,
and must obey the commands of the kingly authority
in the person of Monseigneur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So spoke the maiden hesitatingly, but with precision
and clearness, yet the secretary—it was De
Lionne, not the most heartless man of that age—could
only do, as secretaries are wont on such occasions,
smile, bow, and, as marking his sense of the
justness of her claims to attention, conduct her himself
to the door of the drear chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite at length began to despair, and regret
she had not taken the advice of Giraud. The sensation
of utter weariness, of which De Pontis so often
complained to his daughter in the narrow prison-abode,
was now experienced by herself. Solitude
was only broken by the occasional sound of footsteps—delusive
hope!—they paused not at her door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shout of merry voices was heard from the
court-yard in the interior of the palace. The gay,
richly dressed pages of his eminence, whose turn of
duty had terminated or not arrived, were amusing
themselves in the youthful sports practised in the
household of princes. Personal rencontres and duelling
were such frequent occurrences, that proficiency
in the use of the rapier was an indispensable accomplishment.
Marguerite, venturing to the window,
became sensibly amused and interested by the adroitness
of a youth, who, challenging all his compeers
successively with the foil, remained victor. Cap
and mantle thrown aside, his attitude of defence displayed
to advantage a tall symmetrical form—the
long curling hair falling on the shoulders bespoke a
very youthful age, but the compressed lip, and stern,
fiery eye bent on the adversary, belonged to manhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without an equal, he retired from the arena to
become a spectator of the skill of companions more
equally matched. Marguerite continued at the window,
till of a sudden, being aware that she was herself
the object of the youth’s regard, she withdrew in
confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not much to interest within the chamber.
A map of France, and several battle-pieces, sadly
out of perspective, helped to while away the time.
Looking closely over Limousin, endeavoring to find
the barren waste denominated De Pontis—without
hearing footstep, or other notice of a stranger’s approach,
an arm encircled her waist, and the dark
eye of the page was close to her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there nothing”—said the intruder—“more
amusing to a lady in the <span class='it'>Palais-Cardinal</span> than
poring over a mouldy map? Well! if such be the
taste of Mademoiselle, may I not be her preceptor?
I am accounted an excellent mathematician!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite had been surprised so suddenly as to
be for the moment bereft of speech. Springing from
his grasp, her eyes flashing indignation, she flew to
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The page perceiving the intention, had barely time
to place his hand on the latch, and the foiled maiden
dreading close contact with the insolent intruder,
retreated a few paces, threatening an appeal to the
Cardinal Richelieu.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle has more power over me than his
eminence,” said the page, half smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then prove it by allowing me to quit the apartment
without suffering further insolence,” exclaimed
the damsel firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a hard command—and insolence is a harsh
term,” said the youth, thoughtfully, “but I deserve
it! Believe me, Mademoiselle, when I say how
much I was deceived in the quality of her whom I
approached so foolishly—we are apt to abuse the
license of—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“License!” exclaimed Marguerite, still trembling
with vexation and anger, “meet behavior for a
cardinal’s palace—but make way, sir, and you shall
hear no further of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The page, who evidently by his manner as well as
declaration, had committed the very grave error of
acting towards a lady of quality, with a freedom
which the gay youth of Paris affected in their
chance meeting with females of humbler rank, had,
since his first address, appeared deeply struck with
the beauty and grace of Marguerite. Even sense of
the offence seemed lost and absorbed in his admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving her free to depart, he again expressed
sorrow for the rudeness—and in a tone, and with
language, courteous yet grave and sustained, more
than could have been expected from one of his years,
and of the thoughtless class to which he belonged—reminded
her that he was one of the pages of the
Cardinal De Richelieu; that if her visit to the palace
had reference to any of the household, he would go
immediately in quest of the party, or if she sought
higher audience, his services were at command,
though they would not, perhaps, avail much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The frankness of this declaration rather won upon
the maiden, and tended much to subdue her anger.
Might she not be carrying indignation too far against
one who expressed such contrition for his offence?
Thoughts of her father, of the <span class='it'>Conciergerie</span>, of
Giraud and the implacable <span class='it'>procureur général</span>, rushed
through the mind. Perhaps the youth was thrown
in her path even providentially? Ruin hung suspended
by a slight thread over the family, and could
only be averted by extraordinary and unusual aid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with these feelings, that she declared herself
Marguerite De Pontis, waiting audience of the
cardinal—if he could pleasure her so far as to ascertain
what chance there remained of seeing the prelate
that day, she would accept his services as atonement
for his rudeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“De Pontis!” exclaimed the youth, with an abstracted
air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same,” exclaimed the maiden, rather impatiently,
seeing that he made no effort to depart,
“have I imposed a task too heavy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“De Pontis!—he is in the <span class='it'>Conciergerie du Palais</span>,”
said the page.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! I know it too well,” cried the maiden,
“but why remind me of it? I fear that I have been
wrong myself, in putting trust in a stranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! no! Mademoiselle,” said the page, “not
in putting trust in me, though perhaps I am too humble
to be of service. You appear impatient because
I do not fly, like knight of old, on fair lady’s service—but
truly, I have been weighing between duty and
inclination, and duty, after a hard battle, has been
vanquished. I know the cardinal will hold himself
invisible to Mademoiselle till the decree of sequestration
is obtained. There! it is out now!—and I
have earned my passport to the Bastille!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust not,” replied Marguerite, mournfully, “it
is enough our family is obnoxious to misery in their
own persons, without bringing it on others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These words seemed lost on the page—he paced
the chamber like one irresolute of action—his dark
eye flashing brightly, and then sunk in gloom. Suddenly
approaching the lady with a vehemence and
hastiness which startled her, he exclaimed abruptly,
though in a low tone—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chance, and the employment which falls to my
lot, have made me acquainted with the proceedings
against Monsieur De Pontis, even more than is
suspected by the cardinal. I owe you atonement,
and you must confess that I risk life, or liberty, or
both, in making the reparation I offer—but I deem no
task too heavy or too perilous, which will assist the
hopes of Mademoiselle De Pontis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a warmth in this declaration, an earnestness
of gaze and speech which caused Marguerite’s
eyes to seek the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot accept services bestowed at such risk,”
said the maiden faltering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then my safety has interest in your eyes—or do
I flatter myself too much?” asked the page.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The roses blushed deeply in the cheek of Marguerite—there
was a flutter at the heart—a confusion
which took away the power of reply. With much
to offend delicacy, could she take offence at an offer
which bore the impress of sincerity? Could she sacrifice
the proffered aid to her parent? Might he not be
in possession of the information so coveted by Monsieur
Giraud, information so much more valuable
since she had learned the intention of the cardinal
to avoid granting an audience? But was she justified
in receiving intelligence conveyed at such peril
by the rash youth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>These thoughts chasing each other, produced a
state of mind favorable to the ardent wishes of the
page. He saw her irresolution, and in the recklessness
of the sudden passion he had conceived for the
damsel, was resolved to risk fortune, character and
liberty in her service. Higher aims and loftier destinies
than a page’s state, have been flung away for
the favoring smile of woman’s eye! He had the art
to avoid all allusion to his passion, and dilating only
on the pity felt for the unfortunate veteran, and the
distress his imprisonment must have caused the
daughter—his own indignation at the artifices used
and still in store to deprive the warrior of the well-earned
bounty of royalty—he thus removed the obstacles
which the maidenly delicacy of Marguerite
would have interposed in the acceptation of a stranger’s
services—and whose first introduction afforded
little promise of gentle feelings and regard for her
own sex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>François De Romainville, in devoting himself to
the service of Marguerite with such total disregard
of the dreaded Richelieu, gave one more proof of a
headlong career. He had been twice imprisoned in
the <span class='it'>Palais</span> for disobedience of the cardinal’s orders,
and retained his post only through superior activity
and intelligence, qualities of which the potential
minister had much need. The indignity he suffered,
or believed that he suffered, by the confinement, had
created a bitter animosity against his master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scandalous injustice exercised towards De
Pontis, to which he was privy, tended to paint the
tyrant—as he secretly called him—in blacker colors.
Could he serve the veteran, he revenged his own
wrong on the oppressor—and might win the love of
a maiden for whom he had conceived a passion
whose intensity resembled what he had never experienced,
but oft read of in the pages of romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was much danger in every step—even in
the present interview, he ran the risk of being either
surprised by his companions from whom he had
unperceived stolen away, on beholding a pretty face
at the window above; or incurring the suspicion of
De Lionne, should he send for or seek Mademoiselle,
and find who was in her company. As it was, he
had already rendered himself obnoxious to a severe
reprimand, by intruding into a chamber to which he
had not the privilege of access, unless under command
of his eminence, and though this prohibition
would probably prevent search in such a quarter by
his more prudent compeers, yet the momentary peril
of a visit from usher or functionary attached to the
secretary’s bureau, was great. The best chance of
escape arose from the fact—so distressing to Marguerite—that
the cardinal had no intention of seeing
the maiden, till the intercession she craved would be
of no avail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this consolation, and the last resource in
store of flight unperceived by the back staircase
which had led him so quietly to the chamber, he
gradually induced Marguerite to make him a confidant
in the affairs of her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the Count De Fontrailles,” remarked the
page, “for whom the <span class='it'>droit d’aubaine</span> is intended,
and he lays close siege to it. The count has made
himself necessary to his eminence—he has, what is
called in the language of the bureau, a talent for
affairs. He must have money, is his constant cry—he
spends so much—he had often borrowed of the
Spaniard, and had an eye to the estate on his death—perhaps
he poisoned him—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Merciful Heaven! I hope not!” exclaimed the
maiden in great terror, shocked at the idea of the
crime, and more so at the careless manner in which
it was surmised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What more likely? He might have had to wait
many years otherwise,” replied the page smiling at
her fears, “but I beg pardon of Mademoiselle—she
must teach me to speak in a way better suited to a
lady’s ears. I am the most rude and abrupt of men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now the maiden’s turn to smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle will find that I have a man’s heart
though not his beard,” cried François, with a slight
curl of the upper lip; “there are few, calling themselves
men, would dare oppose the cardinal as I have
done. M. De Pontis and myself are well matched,
and I sympathize with his spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then proceeded to relate that the cardinal and
Fontrailles were much annoyed at the obstinacy of
the old soldier; the necessities of the latter were
outraged by the <span class='it'>droit</span> being jeoparded and withheld
from his clutch; the former, displeased at what he
called the impertinence of an old <span class='it'>moustache</span>, in taking
such sudden advantage of the king’s good-nature.
It had been the occupation of François to carry messages
and commands to the creature named Pedro
Olivera, a Spaniard by birth, long resident in France,
and a tool or subordinate emissary of the courtly
Fontrailles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was much inquiry about certain papers, as
the page affirmed to Marguerite. Pedro had been
also a borrower from the deceased Spaniard, and had
placed with him, as security for repayment, a statement
of claims on his master, Fontrailles, for obscure
and perhaps disreputable services. This was missing,
also a portion of the books and accounts, and it
occasioned, as François happened to know, a domiciliary
search in the lodging of Monsieur De Pontis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If these papers and documents were in existence—and
I suspect by her looks,” said the page, concluding
his narrative, “that she knows something
about them—they could be brought to bear against
Fontrailles and Olivera by a skilful advocate. But
let Mademoiselle De Pontis remember, that I have
placed my life in her hands—a life of value to the
owner if he be permitted to continue in her service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The color flew to the face of Marguerite—she
looked confused, but not displeased—he took her
hand and pressed it to his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the decree, Monsieur François,” said the
damsel timidly, “the advocate fears the <span class='it'>procureur</span>
will obtain it to-morrow if he is not restrained.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True! too true!” exclaimed the page.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He considered a few moments, and then told her
that the only remedy was to gain audience of Richelieu
by stratagem. It was useless her waiting in the
chamber, he was aware, nor would the cardinal be
met with on his departure from the <span class='it'>Palais</span>, in the
public suite of saloons. He knew the hour of his
going abroad, and it would be necessary that Mademoiselle
should repair to the palace garden, wait in
a particular avenue which he indicated, and lie in
ambush for his eminence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will not, he cannot resist your appeal for delay,”
exclaimed François, in a passionate tone,
“Monseigneur proves his want of courage by flying
the field! I wish his eminence had my heart, for
Mademoiselle I find irresistible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again pressing the fair hand to his lips, he escaped
by the entrance which conducted to the back-stairs,
but presently returning, said⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If François, the <span class='it'>houblieur</span>, travels the <span class='it'>Rue St.
Denis</span> this evening, he will not fail to ring his bell
for customers to attend!” and so saying, again disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>houblieurs</span>, or dealers in wafers, a sort of
cake, were accustomed to ring a hand-bell to give
notice of approach in their passage through the
streets; and Marguerite could only construe the
page’s enigma, that he intended visiting her abode
so disguised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Obeying the directions, she resorted without delay
to the palace gardens, and with fear and trembling
took up the station pointed out. A few minutes after
the hour mentioned, chimed by the clock, two ushers
passed the bench where the maiden was seated—she
arose instantly, and the cardinal duke was close at
hand, almost surrounded by a group of gaily dressed
gentlemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her courage forsook her—but it was too late to retreat—she
stood conspicuous in the avenue, and the
great man’s train, accustomed perhaps to similar
rencontres, falling back a few paces, though within
hearing, she confronted the lion in his path. A slight,
almost imperceptible shade crossed his features, but
he stopped, and with princely serenity listened to the
faltering pleading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if the wheels of justice of a mighty kingdom
are arrested for one week, will it content such
a faithful servant of the king?” asked the cardinal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope it will afford time to prove my father’s
innocence, Monseigneur,” replied the maiden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then Mademoiselle’s wishes shall be the law of
France,” rejoined the minister. Bowing with dignity
to the maiden, he passed onward with his suite,
and she was again alone in the avenue.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>NO. VII.—MACBETH.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A few more words on Macbeth as a work of art.
There is a scene so trifling that, to such as are not
prepared to look for meaning in our poet’s lightest
word, it might seem almost superfluous. The “noble
Macbeth” has returned from the battle where his
victorious arm has saved his king and country. His
heart is opened by the dangerous influence of prosperity,
amid the high-beating joys of which the
enemy of mankind has insinuated hopes of a deeper,
more audacious, and guilty nature; but as yet they
are but as hidden serpents beneath the flowers. The
two scenes of the witches have been thrown in—like
sublime strains of music from which an opera is
to take its character, chilling the mind with vague
and startling apprehensions. All this is done with a
few strokes from the terrible master-hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A part of the effect produced by the commencement
of this immense tragedy is owing to the contrast
of the two mighty antagonist principles of human
life—earthly good, on the one side, smiling in the
sunshine, and allowing all who trust it to a full and
fatal confidence, and, on the other, <span class='it'>evil</span> which an omnipotent
and inscrutable Deity has placed in a mysterious
juxtaposition, like a huge Maelstrom, and
from which arises the necessity of ceaseless watchfulness
and the energetic exercise of the moral faculties.
We have all that, to an earthly mind, is noble,
great, exciting and beautiful. Military glory is the
idol which mankind has the most blindly worshiped.
It has no good effect on the moral nature, but, on the
contrary, has a tendency to inflate the soul with vain
confidence and to give the man that most paltry and
foolish of all weaknesses—a pompous idea of his
own greatness. Military glory, then, at its height,
appears to us at the outset of Macbeth. The brave,
patriotic warrior has crushed the rebel and hurled
back the invader from his country’s shore. The acclamations
of the multitude hail the victor as he returns.
He is for the moment invested with the moral
glory of a Washington or a Cincinnatus. Not only
does the nation he has saved regard him with delight
and affection, but the king himself has no words to
express his gratitude, and heaps him at once with
thanks, honors and promises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a noble picture! The storm of war broken
and passed away, leaving the political sky clearer
than before—the good and venerable old king,
whose great age does not permit him to share the
dangers and glory of the actual combat, protected
by the generous and brave hand of a faithful subject!
The people’s apprehensions subside—the soldier returning
to his field, the father embracing once more
his wife and children—the hills and plains about to
wave again with a plentiful harvest—the king left in
safety and peace to form new benevolent plans for
the security and happiness of his affectionate people—and
Macbeth himself—at the pinnacle of a subject’s
happiness—accompanied to his beautiful castle by
his royal and grateful master—promoted in rank—improved
in fortune—the favorite of his king—the
savior of his country—what could Providence bestow
more to make the world an Eden?</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment (Oh Earth! how true a shadowing
forth it is of thy delusive and fatal snares!) the
audience hear the tones of another world—the finger
of another destiny, as unlike that which has charmed
the minds of the multitudes whom we may suppose
to have welcomed the conquering Macbeth, as was
the hand which traced the <span class='it'>writing on the wall</span> at the
feast of Belshazzar. At this moment, hovering in
the air, the shadow gathers, and the destructive, the
corrupting principle, inherent in human things—and
which man was sent on earth to watch for and to
cope with—falls across the path of the hero; dark
and obvious enough to have betrayed to him his danger,
had he been a pure and a pious man, but, through
its withered and hideous disguise, appealing to his
weakness—to his worst passions—with a fascinating
power and a bewildering and intoxicating promise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colossal dimensions of this tragedy are one
of its awful features. In it, Inverness is the world,
the witches are sin, and Macbeth is the proud,
aspiring representative of weak mortality, when
unsupported by religion. The scene to which I have
alluded above, and to which I call the reader’s attention,
comes in amidst massive interests with such a
minuteness of finish, and playfulness and sweetness
of fancy, that one is struck with it as with some of
those accidents accompanying great events in real
life, and from their very insignificance contrasting
with a tremendous power—a bird warbling—a violet
blowing—or a limpid brook singing on its happy
journey where a great battle is about to be fought;
or an infant unconsciously smiling on the bosom of a
dying father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Macbeth has seen the weird sisters, has listened
to their prophecy, has found one of their predictions
verified. He <span class='it'>is</span> Thane of Cawdor! He has caught
the dazzling dream of royalty with an eager and a
determined hand. He has begun to weave in his
ambitious brain the web of his vast designs. He has
not only conceived—he has <span class='it'>yielded</span> to the dire suggestion
whose horrid image unfixed his hair and
made his “seated heart knock at his ribs,” against
the use of nature. He has invoked the stars to hide
their fires, that “light” may not see his “black and
deep desires.” He has met his sinful and earthly
wife, and in the interchange of a few portentous
words, understood even before spoken, (for there is
a freemasonry of guilt as well as of innocence and
honor) he has resolved upon deep hypocrisy, prompt
action, and the most tremendous guilt. That very
night is to become memorable in the history of their
lives and of the world, by a deed of eternal wo.
The sun, now rolling calmly and brightly to his golden
rest, is never to behold again the forth-going of the
silver-haired old monarch, who, with his happy and
triumphant suite, approaches the sweet castle of Inverness;
and the raven has been, (by the deep conjuration
of the blackest of human hearts,) supposed
<span class='it'>hoarse</span> with ominous croakings at the sight of the
happy and confiding king entering beneath those battlements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With what consummate skill these innumerable
ideas are presented to our imagination, and then (and
here is the passage) what a transition from the
gloomy and horrid depths of the corrupt human
heart, to the perfume, radiance, tranquility, picturesqueness,
and ever-soothing routine of external
nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I read the sleep-walking scene of Lady
Macbeth, I think that the most perfect piece of writing
ever seen in profane literature. When I fall
upon the above, it appears to me that is the most
delicate and exquisite in the whole range of our
author’s works. Is it possible that the same tremendous
hand which painted the royal tigress, at
length cowed by the aspect of another world, has
drawn, with a pencil of air, this lovely and inexpressibly
soft scene, where the perfume of a balmy
atmosphere is fresh and soothing on your forehead,
and in your nostril, and where the eye as well as the
smell and ear (for I can hear the breeze murmur
among the green branches, and the screams of joy
uttered by those temple-haunting birds as they chase
each other down the air,) is filled with delight. What
a warm and living picture it is, with the fewest possible
words! An old castle pleasantly situated—its
massive turrets look down over a peaceful, rural
scene, the pure-scented air recommending itself
sweetly and nimbly to our gentle senses! Who that
has spent six or eight hours of the early morning at
a sedentary occupation, in a room, till the senses
were wearied and the limbs ached with sitting—and
the lungs played languishingly and the blood moved
sluggishly—and the pulse beat feebly with exhaustion—who
has not, on going forth, felt this soothing sensation,
as some pleasant landscape spread its tranquil
and soft-colored beauties before his eye, some picturesque
building broke the sameness of the picture
by its bold outlines in the foreground, the ever happy
birds darting about the house eaves—and the life-breathing,
cool, odorous air filling his veins with
sweet impulses, stirring all that is agreeable in his
heart, cooling the fever of the heated brain, and sending
off, with its benign blessing, a world of sad feelings
or melancholy forebodings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In three lines we have this effect; and further,
who expresses this pleasing, living thought—<span class='it'>Duncan!</span>
the doomed victim of the assassin’s dagger.
Yes, he feels the sweetness of nature, and he feels it
for <span class='it'>the last time</span>. Look around thee, old man; those
swells of verdant ground, those murmuring and soft
waving trees, those shadows thickening and blackening
as the eye pierces into the wood, this blue and
bending sky with a few sleeping, fleecy clouds, thou
shalt never see them more. Nature, always so tender
and exquisite, has new and unutterable charms
when we are never to behold it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then <span class='it'>Banquo</span> acknowledges the softening influence
of the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is a picture which the reader sees as if by
mere accident, and the imagination follows out each
hint and goes from one salient point to another till
the life-like scene rises before it. The luxuriancy
and blandness of summer, the beautiful martlets filling
the air as we have watched them with boyish
delight a thousand times, with their noisy joy. They
never appear so pretty as when coming in and out of
their nests under the eaves of a house or barn, and
still more in the buttresses and angles of an old castle.
“Their loved mansionry” gives an additional
impression of the beauty their “pendent beds and
procreant cradles” add to the rough old castle which
itself is brought finely out from the canvass by the
light reflecting from each jutty frieze, buttress and
coigne of vantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Banquo continues the remark with a thought expressive
of an observing, nature-loving mind returning,
with new pleasure, to the repose of peace and
the thoughts and the occupations which there have
room to unfold themselves, after the bloody tumult
of brutal war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not know, but I suppose it must be a truth in
natural history, that the birds spoken of generally
build their nests where the air is purest. See, also,
the superior charm which the little observation possesses,
from the lips of this noble soldier, dropped in
a peaceful, sunshiny moment, skilfully thrown in
after the furious storms of war, and before the yet
more frightful tempest of guilt which is speedily to
fall like a thunderbolt upon this group of human
beings, apparently so far removed from danger, and
about to commence a new era of contentment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Remark here the people collected in a circle
beneath the dark frowning battlements of the war-like
castle now bathed in summer light, and in the
natural ease and gentle satisfaction of their hearts
discussing such beautiful trifles as, however graceful
and soothing, the busy warriors of those rude times
had but small time to occupy themselves with.
Who are they? what are their fates? Alas they
are but too striking types of their fellow creatures
who in the midst of life are in death. Duncan’s
hours are numbered. Beneath the walls of the castle
which his aged eyes survey with such admiration—whose
strong turrets and picturesque buttresses
are now painted with the golden light of a calm summer
afternoon—which he expects to enter to a banquet,
and from which he intends to go forth in the
morning with renewed hope and happiness—beneath
those dire walls in a few hours is to take place a
scene, the farthest possible removed from his suspicions,
and he is to be called, like Hamlet, without
any reckoning, into the presence of his God. Thus
under the crushing and unpausing hand of Destiny
the good and the bad go down alike in a world
through which <span class='it'>he</span> will pass most easily who builds
his hopes elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Banquo too is a good man. You even perceive,
in those few words, that he has a delicacy of nature
which has perhaps preserved him pure from contaminating
influences and illusive temptations. He too
is marked, without demerit of his own, to go down
beneath the wheels of the dreadful impending event.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He too, in a few brief days, is doomed to be cut
off—thrust headlong into eternity, while guilt remains
unhurt and triumphs in the successful execution of
all its plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Macduff—the pious—lion-hearted—affectionate
Macduff, is prepared a fate, if possible, yet more
awful. His castle—the scene of many a happy
hour, many a fond and merry family sport, is about
to be surprised. His wife, his babes “savagely
slaughtered,”</p>

<p class='noindent'>all that could be found, fiercely drawn down into the
general ruin which the sinful heart of one man spreads
around him. How truly is mortality painted in these
events! How plainly we see what stuff life is made
of! and how sternly are we taught the folly of supposing
the end of man to be “here, on this bank and
shoal of time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malcolm, Donalbain, Rosse, and Angus, driven
from their country by terror of the bloody tyrant—(now
the beloved and trusted of all)—and lastly
Lenox, whom we find at a later period in attendance
on Macbeth, and the witness of his bursts of guilty
and ferocious desperation, but at length joined with
the advancing enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into the midst of this circle, on the brink of ruin
when they think themselves most secure, <span class='it'>enters Lady
Macbeth</span>. Her mere appearance touches a chord of
terror in the soul of the reader, although they whom
she addresses view her with very different feelings.
The unsuspecting king greets in her his “honored
hostess,” and pours out upon her a heart full of gratitude
and love. The cruel hypocrite—so firm in the
anticipation of guilt, so haughtily superior to all the
prejudices of superstition—all <span class='it'>the idle dreams of religion
and a Providence</span>—yet so ignorant of their
real nature and destined to be so thoroughly wrecked
in the tempest her rash hand is so eager to raise—replies
with shameful effrontery and mature wickedness:</p>

We know not how to distinguish the false from the

had just risked his life in his defence, or in the “fair

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY FRANCES S. OSGOOD.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good bye, Vivian, don’t fall in love till you see
Miss Walton. God bless you, my dear boy!” And
Vivian Russell shook his kind uncle warmly by the
hand and sprung into the stage coach, which was
waiting for him at the gate. “All right!” said the
guard—the bluff coachman smacked his whip, and
away they sped along the road to London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They will not fly so fast, but that you and I, sweet
reader, can overtake them when we list, though the
swift steeds of Fancy must be harnessed for the purpose.
To please you, then, we will follow them
anon. In the mean time, sit you down by my side
on this sunny bank, opposite the gate, where Vivian’s
uncle still stands and gazes after the fast receding
vehicle, and I will tell you all I know about him.
You had time to see, ere he took his seat in the
coach, that he was a tall, nobly formed youth, possessing,
in an eminent degree, what the French call,
“<span class='it'>Un air distingué</span>.” You could not but notice the
thin silky intellectual looking curls, which waved on
his classical head, (don’t laugh at the word “intellectual!”)
Think a moment! Is there not expression
even in hair? Does not thick, bushy, <span class='it'>stubby</span> hair,
especially if it curl, give you an idea of dullness, sensuality
and want of refinement? If it doesn’t, my
precious reader, take my word for it, you don’t see
with your “mind’s eye,” or at any rate, with <span class='it'>my</span>
mind’s eye. Did you observe <span class='it'>his</span> eyes? They are
black, brilliant and expressive, full of that great
rarity, in this whig and tory world, soul. His complexion
is glowing and slightly brown by exposure.
There is a dimple in his chin, his nose is just like
that of the Apollo Belvidere, and his forehead, how
shall I describe its beauty? broad, white, spiritual,
beaming with thought, I cannot do it justice. There
is the least perceptible curl on his beautiful lip; but
you cannot see it when he smiles; for his smile is
tenderness itself. In his manly bearing too, there is,
perhaps, a dash of aristocratic haughtiness, at first,
but it soon wears away upon acquaintance. The
difficulty is to <span class='it'>become</span> acquainted with him; I defy
a dull or a vulgar person to do it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cheerful, healthy looking old gentleman, who
is just turning from the gate towards that white house
among the trees, is, as I told you, his uncle. Vivian’s
parents died during his childhood, and left him to
this uncle’s care. He has just returned from abroad,
come of age,—taken possession of his paternal
estates,—left the old gentleman to look after it, in
his absence, and gone for the first time to pass a
month or two amid the gaieties of the metropolis.
And now let us after him with what speed we may.</p>

<p class='pindent'>See! there is my friend, Fancy; just in time!
descending in her opal chariot, drawn by a score
of peacocks, which fly or creep, as the wayward
goddess wills. Her rainbow scarf flutters in the air,
her wild blue eyes sparkle with excitement, as she
beckons us towards her. Give me your hand, sweet
reader! so, one bound, and we are safe by her side;
and now we too are on our road to London, and our
vehicle glances like a meteor through the air. Since
then we are so comfortably <span class='it'>en route</span>, let me just
explain my motive for having been, as some will
think, unnecessarily minute in my description of our
hero. It was because I wished my young lady
readers,—for whom this story is especially intended,
to be interested in him, and I thought the surest way of
making them so, was to let them trace, in his person
as well as mind, a remarkable resemblance to some
favored acquaintance of their own. Have I succeeded?
Mary, Caroline, Julia, Isabel! Is he not
the “perfect <span class='it'>image</span>” of—you know who? There—don’t
blush, dear! I won’t tell. “<span class='it'>Revenons à nos
moutons.</span>” Hey day! what have we here? A
traveling chariot broken down in the road! Our
friend Vivian bearing a lady in his arms towards the
neighboring inn, which the stage coach has already
reached! An old gentleman, probably her father,
staring and hurrying after them as fast as the gout
will let him, and the servants, postilions &amp;c., busy in
untackling the horses and righting the injured vehicle.
We won’t stop to inquire the cause of the accident.
Fancy will tell us that at her leisure. Let us enter
the inn.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Margaret, are you well enough to
proceed?” said the old gentleman to his daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! yes—papa!—quite well—” and she rose to tie
on her bonnet. “But, papa!”—Margaret hesitated
and blushed⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, child! what now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think before we go, we should thank the young
man, who so politely assisted me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fudge! we shall have time enough to thank him,—we
must go in the same coach. I can’t stay here
all night to have the chariot repaired. Come, child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took their seats in the coach; Vivian entered
after them and found himself opposite the dark-eyed
girl, who had been thrown from the chariot, fortunately
without injury, and whom he had carried
half fainting to the inn. By her side was her father,
and by Vivian’s side, a spruce and fidgetty youth,
a would-be exquisite, daintily arrayed as that peculiar
race are wont to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The refreshed horses galloped steadily forward;
the first mile-stone was passed; and poor Margaret’s
graceful neck really began to ache,—she had looked
so long out of the opposite window, to avoid Vivian’s
earnest, though half furtive gaze. So she calmly
drew from her pocket a suspicious looking twist of
a billet, and, drooping her dark lashes, began
gravely and assiduously to tear it into small bits,
placing them carefully in a bag which hung upon
her arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Vivian could indulge his passionate fondness
for the beautiful to his heart’s content; for the
old gentleman was fast asleep, and Margaret only
once raised her eyes, and, meeting his, dropped them
again to her work, while a swift, bright blush stole up
for a moment to her cheek, and left it pale as before.
Her countenance was singularly beautiful. It was not
dark, but there was a soft, mellow, sunny tone all
over it, which, with her glossy, raven braids, rosy
mouth, and long black lashes, produced a strangely
rich effect. She wore a dark and very elegant
traveling habit fitting closely to her beautiful bust;
while a bonnet of ruby velvet formed a striking contrast
with her deep, bright eyes and almost colorless
cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she continued her employment, drawing from
her pocket and disposing of note after note, Vivian
could not but watch and admire the wonderful play
of expression on the lip, brow and cheek before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to him, that he could trace, on that ever
changing and ever eloquent countenance, the shadow
of each succeeding thought, as it passed from her
mind. Its prevailing expression was that of endearing
tenderness and sweetness; but ever and anon,—a
sudden arching of the lovely lip, a starry gleam of
dimples on the cheek, and a momentary flash of irrepressible
merriment through the fringing lashes of the
half raised hazel eyes, betrayed that mirth was
making holiday in her heart. But why? And to
whom was that sportive glance directed? Not to
Vivian, alas! but to the stranger at his side; and
though he had never seen the lady before—had not
been introduced, and was ignorant even of her name,
a pang of jealousy shot like an icicle through his
heart, at the thought. But when he turned to look
upon the object of the fair girl’s evident enjoyment—he
too smiled involuntarily. Nearly all the scraps
of paper, that escaped from the slight fingers of
Margaret, had alighted on the precious habiliments of
the beau, who, when Vivian turned, was busily
employed in brushing them off, with a look of solemn
distress, that was irresistibly ludicrous. Alas for the
dandy! His was an endless task. He had no
sooner succeeded in disengaging the intruders from
one part of his dress, than they flew to another, and at
last dared to settle even in those shining and scented
locks, which he had taken off his hat to display.
This was too much. He put up both his hands. He
shook himself. He tried to look up to his own hair!
As a last resource, he contrived to raise his enormous
mouth and blow upwards into his curls! Imagine,
reader, that long and stupid face, in the awkward
position I have described! The head bent, the
almost white eyebrows elevated, the chin depressed,
the under lip protruded and the lugubrious looking
youth pulling with all his might! It was all in vain,
and growing desperate, the hapless dandy meekly
leaned towards Vivian, and said—“May I trouble
<span class='it'>you</span>, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our hero returned his imploring look
with one of petrifying hauteur.——“Did you
address yourself to me, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir!—I—I—would
you be so good, sir, as to—to⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In short, sir, will you have the goodness to
release my hair from the white favors, with which
the young lady opposite has been so kind as to honor
me?” Vivian bowed low and replied with equal
solemnity, “Sir, I beg to inform you, that I have
never been so thoroughly initiated into the mysteries
of a barber’s vocation, as to do justice to your
hyacinthine ringlets.” So saying, the haughty youth
turned once more to gaze at his lovely <span class='it'>vis-à-vis</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was looking very demure, pursing her pretty
mouth, and quietly bending her dark eyes upon the
paper, which, she took care, should no longer annoy
her fellow traveler. Vivian gazed at her with
mingled surprise and admiration. What could be
the meaning of her strange occupation? He would
not condescend to feel inquisitive; yet he could not
help fancying it was some clandestine correspondence,
which she was ashamed to have known, but
with which she could not bear to part altogether.
When once this idea had taken possession of his
mind, he could not dismiss it, and he was just working
himself up into a most unreasonable fit of anger
with his unconscious and unoffending companion,
when, to his dismay, the coach stopped at the
Saracen’s Head in London, and he was obliged to
bid the lady a reluctant good-morning, without a
hope of ever seeing her again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth is, he was desperately in love for the
first time in his life, and a thousand times did he
lament his carelessness, in not having endeavored to
discover her name and residence in town. All the
information he could gather from her conversation
with her father was, that they were hurrying home
from the country in expectation of a visit from a
friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first fortnight after his arrival was spent in
vain inquiries among his friends about the fair engrosser
of his thoughts. As he was ignorant of her
name, he could of course obtain no information with
regard to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning, at breakfast, he received a letter
from his uncle; but before I apprise my reader of its
contents, I must state a fact which has hitherto been
forgotten, namely, that one object of our hero’s
journey had been to fulfill an engagement, which his
uncle had made for him, to pass a few weeks in the
neighborhood of London, at Walton Hall, the residence
of an old friend of his father’s, whom he had
never seen. He had half promised his uncle that he
would give but three days to the novelties of the metropolis,
previous to the promised visit. The following
is an extract from the old gentleman’s letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear boy, I have just received a letter from
my old friend Walton, in which he expresses his surprise
that you have not yet made your appearance at
Walton Hall. I am anxious and disappointed at this,
for I have been fancying you already deeply in love
with my pet Maggie, and indeed I dreamed last
night that I saw you together,” etc., etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of Vivian’s virtues was decision, and another
was energy. Without the latter, the first would be
almost valueless. Ere two hours had elapsed, he
was seated in the drawing-room at Walton Hall,
awaiting the appearance of its owner. He recalled,
with some misgivings, the contents of his uncle’s
letter. “He has set his heart upon my marriage
with Miss Walton, and I have set mine upon this
bewitching unknown. My poor, kind uncle! I regret
his disappointment. I dare say Miss Margaret
is a very nice, well-behaved young person, but my
affections are irrevocably devoted to another, and it
can never be!” Just as he came to this sublime conclusion,
he heard a far off voice, the very first tone
of which he could not help loving, it was so sweet,
so rich, and seemed so fresh from the heart. It was
warbling snatches of a simple ballad, one only sentence
of which he could distinctly hear; but that
sentence he never forgot⁠—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>One only she loved, and forever!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;She wore an invisible chain</p>
<p class='line0'>That Pride wildly struggled to sever;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And daily more deep grew the pain!</p>
<p class='line0'>“Ah, vain,” she would sigh, “each endeavor!”</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And Echo still answered “in vain!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>And as the voice sang, it came nearer and nearer,
and did not cease till the singer, a beautiful girl, tripping
gaily into the room, beheld and, blushing deeply,
curtsied to our hero. Could he believe his eyes?
“It is—it is⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Walton,” said the lady, finishing
the sentence for him, and recovering instantly
her self-possession.
“You wish to see my father? I will send him to
you immediately;” and she glided from the room,
leaving poor Vivian in doubt whether he were dreaming
or awake. If awake, then were the half-dreaded
Miss Walton and the lovely unknown of the stage-coach
one and the same person! And he had wasted
a whole precious fortnight, that he might have passed
in her society! Well, he would make the most of
his <span class='it'>present</span> visit at any rate; and so thinking, he
made his best bow to Mr. Walton, who now entered,
and who, most cordially shaking hands with him,
welcomed him to Walton Hall, as the son of his
oldest and dearest friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you sent up your card,” continued he, “I
little thought that I should find in Vivian Russell the
youth who so kindly assisted my daughter when our
chariot was overturned. I regret that we did not
know you then; but we must make up for lost time.
Your uncle promised me a long visit from you, and I
trust you have come to fulfill the promise.” After a
short conversation, Vivian agreed to return in time
for breakfast the next day, and remain for several
weeks.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Down, Vivian, down!” exclaimed Margaret
Walton, as she entered the breakfast room, from the
lawn, and gracefully welcomed Mr. Vivian Russell
to the Hall. The dog had been named and presented
to her father, by our hero’s uncle, a short time before;
and Vivian thought he had never known the mimic
of his own name, till now, when pronounced by that
sweet and playful voice. Margaret seemed to him
lovelier than ever, in her plain white robe, her color
heightened by exercise, and a few wild flowers, carelessly
wound into the soft braids of her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Papa is a late riser, Mr. Russell, and we must
wait breakfast for him; but he will soon be down
now—” as she spoke, she seated herself, and began,
with an arch, sidelong glance at Vivian, who could
not repress a smile—yes! actually began, to tear
in pieces another of those tormenting little notes!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum!” said Vivian to himself, “the clandestine
correspondence goes swimmingly on, it seems. I
will think of her no more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think of her no more!” He thought of nothing
else all that day and the next and the next; and each
day with a more fervent and impassioned devotion!
She was so mild, yet so noble!—so tenderly beautiful!
he half worshiped her already. And yet those
papers. He detested deceit from his soul. Falsehood,
equivocation, deception of any kind, from a
child he had been too proud to stoop to them; and
here he was, irretrievably in love with one who had
evidently something wrong to conceal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, the servant brought her a note—“From
Sir George Elwyn, Miss.” A smile dimpled her
cheek as she read, and then it shared the fate of many
that had gone before it, and the bits were preserved
as usual in the little basket by her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This then,” thought Vivian, “is the secret!
This Sir George, confound him! is the lover—the
beloved!” And for three whole days after this wise
conclusion did our hero sulk in silent misery; and
for three whole days did the wondering Margaret
weep, when alone, for his waywardness, and, when
in his presence, laugh more gaily than ever, or curl
her sweet lip, in maiden pride, at his moody replies
to her attempts at conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third day was the sabbath, and as they walked
home from church, a fine-looking young man passed
on horseback, and bowed, with an air of “empressement,”
to Miss Walton and her father. “He’s a
confounded handsome fellow! don’t you think so,
Vivian?” said Mr. Walton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who, sir?” said Vivian with an abstracted air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young man, who just passed, Sir George
Elwyn. He is to dine with us, to-day.” Vivian
started at the name and gazed earnestly at Margaret,
who, of course, blushed as was her wont. That
blush decided him. “I was right!” he exclaimed
internally, and making a hurried excuse to leave
them, he hastened by a shorter path to the house—wrote
a note, in which, disclaiming dissimulation, he
only begged his kind host to forgive his abrupt
departure from the Hall, left it on his dressing-table,
mounted his horse, and galloped back to town,
thinking himself the most miserable fellow in
existence.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“What the deuse!” exclaimed Mr. Walton, as he
read the farewell billet of our hero—“Margaret,”—and
he suddenly looked enlightened on the subject—“I
hope <span class='it'>you</span> are not the cause of this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span>, sir! <span class='it'>I</span> the cause?” replied the conscious girl,
with a very demure look of surprise—“What have
<span class='it'>I</span> done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father could not well say <span class='it'>what</span> she had done,
so he said nothing; but he looked annoyed and
sorry, and he found fault with the dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Vivian Russell had a strange, and, as
he thought, a very provoking dream. He thought he
was toiling over brake and brier, in pursuit of Margaret’s
paper basket, which hovered like a “will o’
the wisp” before him, and enticed him into all sorts of
dangers, up hill and down, through bog and stream,
till at last, when, on the top of a high mountain, he
thought it just within his grasp, an angel-face
gleamed for a moment from a low cloud close by,
and a white arm, reaching out, snatched the treasure
from his outstretched hand, and vanished with it
from his sight!</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a week afterwards, our hero, wretched and
restless, tried hard to forget the maiden and her
folly, as he chose to term it; but her image would
not leave him. Sleeping or waking, he saw her
destroying, to conceal yet preserve, the billet-doux
of the happy and handsome Sir George Elwyn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a shameful waste of time!” he exclaimed
one day in a sudden fit of virtuous indignation. “To
be sure, she does a great deal else: She writes,
reads, draws, sews for the poor, &amp;c., &amp;c.; but then
many a moment, which might be more profitably
employed, is squandered in this preposterous occupation,
which she really seems to make a business
of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a shameful waste of time!” whispered
conscience in return. “To be sure you ride, lounge,
sleep, eat, &amp;c. &amp;c., but then many a moment, which
might be more profitably employed, is squandered in
these preposterous reveries, which you really seem
to make a business of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one of his daily rides, Vivian felt himself irresistibly
impelled towards the Hall, and after wandering
for some time within sight of the house, in the
vain hope of catching a glimpse of its fair inhabitant,
he strolled without any definite object into the
village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he approached a low cottage, he saw a form,
which he could not mistake, entering the door, followed
by a footman. The door closed after them;
but the window was open, and Vivian glanced in.
It <span class='it'>was</span> Margaret! She was in the act of taking a
pillow from the hand of her attendant. “See!” she
said to the poor woman of the cottage, who was
lying on a bed, looking very ill, “I have brought
you another pillow. I hope it will ease your poor
shoulders; it is softer than the last, for I tore the
papers, with which it is stuffed, much finer;” and
tenderly raising the invalid, she placed the pillow
beneath her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The papers, with which it is stuffed! and this,
then, is their destination! and Sir George’s note is in
the old woman’s pillow! And I called it a waste of
time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vivian was half wild with joy and surprise. He
staid to hear no more, but flew rather than walked
back to the Hall, and contrived to make his peace
with Mr. Walton, and accept an invitation for dinner,
before the unconscious Margaret had returned
from her errand of benevolence. As he saw her
approach from the window, he hurried out to meet
her, his face glowing with the joyous excitement of
his discovery, and, hastily drawing her arm through
his, exclaimed,—“I’m so happy! It is all right!
I was quite mistaken; I’m so happy!” When she
first recognized him, Margaret’s beautiful features
lighted up, for a moment, with irrepressible joy; but
the glow faded as she recalled the discourteous manner
of his departure, and though she did not withdraw
the arm he had taken, she received his protestations
of happiness at their meeting, with a quiet dignity
and reserve, which amply punished our impetuous
lover for his fault. But though she would not deign
to inquire in <span class='it'>what</span> he was mistaken, by degrees the
reserve wore off beneath the genial and irresistible
influence of Vivian’s frank and joyous demeanor, and
for the rest of the day she allowed herself to be as
happy as her heart bade her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As our hero sat by her work-table after tea, a sudden
thought came into his head. “I will see if my
writing will share the fate of others,” said he to himself.
And scribbling, upon some paper, the verse
he had heard her sing on his first visit—beginning
with, “One only I love and forever,” he cut it into
small pieces and placed it on the table before her,
at the same time laughingly pointing to the fatal
basket. Margaret began to join the pieces, succeeded
in the first line, colored, smiled as she read,
and making a playful feint of putting them in the
basket, threw them at last, with would-be carelessness,
into a book, which lay open on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vivian’s heart beat high! and higher still, when,
gently taking his pencil from his hand, she wrote on
a card, and cut to pieces, the following lines, which
after much puzzling he placed correctly together.
“I sincerely congratulate the ‘one only.’ He or
she, whichever it may be, will be happy certainly in
the <span class='it'>invariable</span> devotion you display.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vivian bit his lip at the word “invariable;” for he
remembered his fit of ill-humor. But he did not
despair, he wrote again, as follows,⁠—</p>

<p class='noindent'>Margaret seemed to become suddenly sensible that
this at least was a clandestine correspondence; for
blushing again more deeply than before, she rose and
left the room, with the paper still in her hand. She
did not return that evening, and our hero began to
fear that his half playful, half in earnest declaration
had offended her. They met at breakfast, however,
and save a slight additional shade of reserve, her
manner was the same as usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vivian knew not what to think. He pined to be
relieved, but he would not, without further encouragement,
hazard another and more formal declaration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Awaking from his reverie, he found himself alone
in the breakfast-room, turning, unconsciously, the
key of Margaret’s work-box. Suddenly a little secret
door sprung open at his accidental touch, and there,
on a tiny shelf, lay a paper with “Vivian,” written
on the outside, in a delicate female hand! Bewildered
with love and hope, he opened it ere he
thought of the dishonor of so doing, and found—(yes!
it was no dream and he was the happiest of the
happy!)—the very bits of paper, which he had laid
before her the night previous, and which she had
thrown so carelessly into a book! Forgetting, in his
passionate delight, the impropriety, the indelicacy of
allowing her to know that her secret was betrayed,
he hurriedly penciled on a card⁠—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest Margaret;
by a blessed accident, I have discovered the
secret shelf—its contents are a token to me that you
have rightly construed my earnest devotion of word
and manner. Dare I imagine it also a token that
you approve that devotion? Tell me, sweet Margaret,
say but one word, but let that word be ‘yes,’
and I am yours only and forever,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Vivian</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He placed it on the shelf, hastily closed the little
door, and left the house; after meeting Mr. Walton
on the stairs, and promising to call the next day.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Vivian was punctual to his appointment; but Miss
Walton received him with a cold and quiet dignity,
for which he could not account. Her cheek was
flushed, and she looked as if she had been weeping
bitterly. She was slowly tearing a note. As soon
as she had finished, she touched the spring of the
secret door, and, taking from the shelf the unfortunate
card, deliberately tore it into atoms, and placed
the bits in the basket. Vivian gazed upon her in
mingled astonishment and despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wont they hurt the poor woman’s head?” asked
he, attempting to smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so much as they have hurt my <span class='it'>heart</span>,” replied
Margaret in a low tone, and rising as she spoke, she
was gone before he had time to reply. He resolved
to ask an explanation, and simply writing, “How
have I offended you?”—he again used the secret
shelf as a repository for his thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day he called again. The box was still
on the table, but the little door, the shelf, the note,
had vanished, and only a hollow space disfigured our
heroine’s beautiful India work-box. It seemed she
was determined to have no secret correspondence,
either with him or any one else. Vivian thought
himself alone, and, leaning his head on the box,
sighed deeply. His sigh was echoed, and, looking
up, he caught Margaret’s eyes bent mournfully upon
him—blushing she turned away. He sprung up,
caught her hand, drew her gently to the sofa, and
pointing to the box, looked imploringly, but silently,
in her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” she said, in a faltering voice, “how could
you so humble me in my own eyes, as to let me
know that you had discovered the only secret I ever
had in my life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden light flashed upon Vivian’s mind!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that it, dearest Margaret? It <span class='it'>was</span> wrong,
it was indelicate; but I did not think of it then, I was
so happy, and Heaven knows I have suffered enough
for my fault! Forgive me! you <span class='it'>will</span> forgive me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have already forgiven you, Vivian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that is not enough; you must do more than
forgive, you must love me, dear one!” he murmured,
drawing her tenderly towards him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must I?” said Margaret playfully; “Well, then,
if I must, I must! I have always been a pattern of
obedience—have I not, papa?” and Mr. Walton entering,
as she spoke, the happy but embarrassed girl
escaped from Vivian’s ardent thanks, and flew to her
chamber, to recall his every look and tone, and to
live over again in fancy the joy of that delightful interview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour afterwards, he joined her in her walk, and
gave her the whole history of his love, his suspicions
and his jealousy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so, Mr. Vivian Russell,” said the lady,
when he had concluded, “those harmless atoms of
paper have been the cause of all this misunderstanding
and estrangement. Truly, indeed, said the bard
that,</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Poems of Alfred Tennyson. Two vols. 12mo. Boston,
William D. Ticknor. Philadelphia, Carey &amp; Hart.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Of the works of cotemporary English poets of the
second class, perhaps none have been more commented upon
or less read in America than those of Alfred Tennyson.
The chief reason may be that never until now having
been reprinted here, and a very small number only of
the first English impression having been imported, they
have not been accessible to many whom the praises or
the reviewers would have led to examine into their pretensions.
The Cardinal de Richelieu, it is said, fancying
himself as skilled in poetry as in diplomacy, wrote a tragedy,
which having been damned on its anonymous presentation
to the critics, he tore into atoms and burned. For
like cause Mr. Tennyson, soon after the publication of his
“Poems, chiefly Lyrical,” committed all the copies of them
he could regain to the fire. But the cardinal and our cotemporary
erred. Time, not fire, is the trier of verse.
Upon the surface of the stream of ages the good will at
some period rise to float forever, the middling for a while
live in the under current of the waters, and in the end,
with the utterly worthless, sink into the oblivious mire at
the bottom. To this conclusion Mr. Tennyson seems now
to have been brought, for he has this summer republished his
early poems, with many new ones which, though free from
some of the more conspicuous faults of his first productions,
generally lack their freshness, beauty and originality. We
look in vain in the second volume of the edition before us
for pieces surpassing his Mariana, Oriana, Madeline, Adeline,
Margaret, The Death of the Old Year, or parts of
The Dream of Fair Women. He excels most in his female
portraitures; but while delicate and graceful they are indefinite;
while airy and spiritual, are intangible. As we
read Byron or Burns, beautiful forms stand before us, we see
the action of their breathing, read the passionate language
of their eyes, involuntarily throw out our arms to embrace
them; but we have glimpses only of the impalpable creations
of Tennyson, as far away on gold-fringed clouds they
bend to listen to dreamlike melodies which go up from fairy
lakes and enchanted palaces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tennyson has been praised as a strikingly original poet.
He has indeed a bold and affluent fancy, whereby he tricks
out common thoughts in dresses so unique that it is not
always easy to identify them; but we have not seen in his
works proofs of an original mind. He certainly is not an
inventor of incidents, for most of those he uses were familiar
in the last century. Dora he acknowledges was suggested
by one of Miss Mitford’s portraits, and the Lady Clare by
Mrs. Farrar’s Inheritance; The Day Dream, The Lady of
Shalott, and Godiva, are versions of old tales, skilfully
made, but showing no creative power. There is a statue-like
definiteness and warmth of coloring about the following
stanzas from the first of these poems which we have not
elsewhere observed in his writings:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet this sense is sometimes dead in him, and he exhibits
as little taste as is possessed by ante-diluvian McHenry. A
critic for whose judgment we have great respect, and who
seems determined to believe Mr. Tennyson “the first original
English poet since Keats, perhaps the only one of the
present race of verse writers who carries with him the certain
marks of being remembered hereafter with the classic
authors of his language,” points to St. Simeon Stilites as the
finest of his productions. It is not his worst, but if he had
not written better we should desire none of his companionship.

<p class='pindent'>At length the miserable fool, with no rebuke for the heathen
thought that God is moved by penances like these instead
of active efforts to promote His cause and human happiness,
working miracles such as the earliest saints performed,
climbs up into his airy home and there “receives
the blessed sacrament.” Where is Mr. Tennyson’s “high,
spiritual philosophy,” and “transcendental light?” The
ideas, imagery and style of expression in this poem are
familiar to all readers of monkish stories, and from the beginning
of it to the end there are not half a dozen lines to
be remembered when the book is closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We cannot foretell to what degree of popularity these
poems will attain in America. The fewness of the copies
here, before the appearance of the present edition, enabled
some persons to steal the author’s livery and achieve great
reputation among a class who will now transfer their admiration
to him who “stole at first hand from Keats.”
That Tennyson has genius cannot be denied, but his chief
characteristics pertaining to style, they will not long attract
regard. We have better poets in our own country—Bryant,
Longfellow, and others—who put “diamond thoughts in
golden caskets;” and all true critics will prefer their simple
majesty or beauty to the fantastic though often tasteful
and brilliant displays of Tennyson. The difference between
them is like that which distinguishes the sparkling
frost that vanishes in the sun from ingots of silver that may
be raked into heaps and will last forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our attention has been directed to resemblances between
the poems of Tennyson and those of our own quaint and
felicitous humorist, Doctor Oliver Wendell Holmes. We
have not space for a parallel. The first is a man of fortune
who has given twenty years to the poetic art; the last a
young physician who, devoting all his time to a laborious
profession, has little leisure for dalliance with the muse,
and no ambition to win “a poet’s fame.” Yet even as a
versifier Holmes is equal to Tennyson, and with the same
patient effort and care, he would in every way surpass him
as an author.</p>

Follow?” Two Vols. 12mo. New York, Charles S.

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These are charming volumes, written with a freshness
and spirit that delights and would surprise us were we not
familiar with the first work of their author. Mrs. Kirkland
has opened a new vein in our national literature. Her
sketches of forest scenery and wood-craft, with all its varied
details, are not less true than graphic. We Americans
are probably inclined to think too lightly of the vigor and
intelligence displayed in them; that bad old adage about
the estimate of a prophet in his native land unfortunately
applies with force to Mrs. Kirkland, Mrs. Brooks and some
other writers of this country whose works, while they excite
comparatively little attention here, are passing through
numerous editions abroad. All the world has read the
pleasant stories in “Our Village,” by Miss Mitford. We
institute no comparison between her and our own “Mary
Clavers,” but we think our countrywoman has exhibited
powers infinitely superior to those of the popular delineator
of English rural life. She is sometimes <span class='it'>extravagant</span>, indeed;
but a tendency to extravagance has its foundation in
nature, and is necessary in all works of art, from pen or
pencil, to produce a true impression. Having made a pedestrian
tour through the country about “Montecute,” a
few years ago, and gained by observation some knowledge
of its inhabitants, we thought after glancing at a few of
Mrs. Kirkland’s chapters that she had exaggerated too much
their peculiarities; but on closing her volumes we are as
confident of their truth as of their extreme cleverness. One
or two of Miss Mitford’s stories may be read with pleasure,
and a philosopher can endure a third; but the fourth invariably
induces sleep or weariness. There is, however, no
monotony to pall in “Mary Clavers;” the tragic and the
comic, the pathetic and the droll, succeed each other so
rapidly in her works that they are as various in their tone
as the inimitable “Don Juan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We might find some faults in “Forest Life,” but its good
qualities so predominate that the task becomes both difficult
and ungracious. We will allude to one only—the too frequent
introduction of French words and phrases—not, certainly,
from vanity, for no woman has less affectation than
our author—but doubtless from habit and a desire of condensation.
A pithy French phrase of three words, <span class='it'>to those
who understand the language</span>, will frequently convey more
meaning than half a dozen English lines; but, Mrs. Clavers,
there are in this world a vast number of very decent people
who know as little of French as a politician does of
honesty.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The American in Egypt, with Rambles through Arabia Petræa
and the Holy Land, during the Years 1839 and 1840.
By James Ewing Cooley. Illustrated with numerous
Steel Engravings, and Etchings by D. C. Johnston. One
vol. 8vo., pp. 610. New York, D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1842.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We have seen few American books comparable to this
in elegance of paper, typography and embellishments. The
richest productions of the printers of London and Paris do
not surpass it. Of its literary character—having read but
a few chapters—we can speak with less confidence. The
author, with his family, we believe left New York in the
autumn of 1828, and making pleasure the principal object of
his pursuit, passed through the most interesting portions of
Europe, Africa and Asia. He was in Egypt during an important
period, and enjoyed there all the facilities he could
well desire for the acquisition of information. But so
numerous are the works relative to that country, which
have been published within a few years, that little in regard
to its antiquities or social condition was left to be discovered,
and instead, therefore, of presenting familiar statistics
and minute descriptions of fallen columns and crumbling
arches, Mr. Cooley has given us a gallery of character-sketches
in which the various classes of travelers, exiles,
and other “Franks,” encountered on the banks of the Nile,
on the deserts and among the ruins, are exhibited. We
cannot tell to what degree of confidence these portraitures
are generally entitled, but we fancy the English tourists
are not truly represented in his “Wrinklebottoms” and
“Sneezebiters;” and we are sure our intelligent consul at
Cairo, Mr. Gliddon, is not the real original of the picture
which bears his name. Mr. Cooley sometimes writes carelessly
and incorrectly; such phrases as “fellow-townsmen”
and some others in the volume before us, may pass without
reproof in hasty conversation, but it is not easy to excuse
their appearance in a printed book. Though far from faultless,
“The American in Egypt” is an instructive and amusing
record of travels and observations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. James has probably written more than any other living
English author. We have not now a list of his works,
but a London bookseller advertises a set of them, as “nearly
complete,” containing <span class='it'>one hundred and twenty-three volumes</span>.
Many of them are historical, and one is poetical;
but the greater number is composed of novels and romances.
These last have some excellent qualities which distinguish
them from nearly all other works of their kind, especially
from the romances of Walter Scott. They are truer as
histories than the chronicles and biographies of the author
of Waverley. Whatever incidents he may invent, Mr.
James draws his real characters with scrupulous fidelity.
Philip Augustus, Richelieu, and Henri IV. are great historical
pictures, of which the details are imaginary, but the
general impression given so correct that a man may learn
nearly as much by reading them as from Sismondi’s
History of France for the periods to which they relate.
While Scott’s histories are as unworthy of credit as his
novels, James, in his historical writings, is singularly careful
as well about their minutest incidents as their principal
effect, so that he is in a way one of the best of living
historians. Of The Life of Edward the Black Prince
we have not space for a review; but we have found it exceedingly
interesting, and we gladly commend it to the
favorable attention of our readers.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Any work descriptive of the characters and events of the
great Irish rebellion of 1798, must possess considerable interest.
The volumes before us, while they are written
with a kindness and candor which distinguish few of the
chronicles of the stormy period to which they relate, are
constructed so carelessly, are so destitute of continuity and
method, as to deserve little praise for their literary execution.
The notices of Emmett, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, the
brothers John and Henry Sheares, to whose fate the indignant
eloquence of Curran imparted such interest, and many
others will, however, enchain the reader’s attention and
well reward him for laboring through the more heavy
passages. It is estimated by the most moderate judges
that the number of persons slain during the rebellion
was not less than seventy thousand; twenty thousand on
the side of the government, and fifty thousand on that of the
insurgents; and it is generally admitted that more were
murdered in cold blood than fell on the fields of battle. The
judicial investigations which followed were mere mockeries,
and the whole conduct of the triumphing government
so atrocious as to shock the sensibilities of the whole civilized
world. The history of these scenes cannot yet be
written. Doctor Madden has but added material to the
accumulating stores which await some laborious and skilful
writer of the next century. His work will fulfill its office
by attracting a momentary attention to the subject, and
afterward by appearing as an authority in quotations on
the margins of a successor’s pages.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Alexander Hamilton Bogart.</span>—Our attention was not
long ago called to this name by the number of elegiac
verses and eloquent obituary paragraphs upon “the admired
and lamented young Bogart,” which we found in an old
file of Albany papers, while referring to them for other
matters connected with some researches in which we were
at the time engaged. On inquiring in his native city for
the productions of one whose early death had caused so
general a sensation in the community of which he was a
member, we found that he was still remembered, and
still deplored. His literary abilities, not less than his
personal character, seemed to have left a profound impression
on all who knew him; but of his writings we could
recover scarcely any, and those we obtained were principally
of a fragmentary character. Yet these fragments,
though their local and personal allusions were lost upon us,
as they would be upon most of our readers, had in them
veins of sentiment and humor that sufficiently proved the
easy and versatile genius of their author, and inspired the
regret that a man evidently so gifted had not left his countrymen
some more finished mementos of his genius. Mr.
Bogart was a native of the city of Albany, where, at the
early age of twenty-one years, he died, in 1826. He was
engaged in the study of the law at the time of his decease,
and, as we have learned from an eminent member of the
bar in that city, gave the highest promise of professional
reputation, when his studies were interrupted by the illness
which terminated in his death. In an interval of that illness,
he is said to have destroyed such of his writings as were
within his reach. The following spirited song, being happily
in the hands of a friend, escaped with the fragments
we have already alluded to, and, judging by them, is a characteristic
specimen of his verse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Bogart composed with singular rapidity, and would
frequently astonish his companions by an improvisation
equal to the elaborate performances of some poets of distinguished
reputation. It was good-naturedly hinted on one
occasion that his impromptus were prepared beforehand,
and he was asked if he would submit to the application of
a test of his poetical abilities. He promptly acceded, and
a most difficult one was immediately proposed. Among his
intimate friends were the late Colonel John B. Van Schaick
and Charles Fenno Hoffman, both of whom were present.
Said Van Schaick, taking up a copy of Byron, “The name
of <span class='it'>Lydia Kane</span>”—a lady distinguished for her beauty and
cleverness, who died a year or two since, but who was
then just blushing into womanhood—“the name of Lydia
Kane has in it the same number of letters as a stanza of
‘Childe Harold;’ write them down in a column.” They
were so written by Bogart, Hoffman and himself. “Now,”
he continued, “I will open the poem at random; and for
the ends of the lines in Miss Lydia’s <span class='it'>acrostic</span> shall be used
the words ending those of the verse on which my finger
may rest.” The stanza thus selected was this:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>John Jacob Astor</span>, the wealthiest citizen of the United

thousand dollars to the establishment of a public
library in New York, an elegant and durable edifice is
being built in the most pleasant part of the city for its reception,
and Doctor Cogswell, a gentleman of taste and
sound learning, is engaged in the purchase of books for it.
There are a large number of libraries in America, owned
by societies and individuals, but none yet for the <span class='it'>public</span>, and
none that, if they were free like the great libraries of the
old world, would be of much use to men of science or letters.
To so many of the million as can buy shares in them
those of Boston, New York and Philadelphia will afford
sufficient means of amusement, but if a man wishes to explore
any department of science, moral, political, or historical,
and resorts to them, he will soon be compelled to
abandon his researches or to go abroad for their prosecution.
Indeed, except the library of Congress, which is not
half so good as an intelligent <span class='it'>bibliopole</span> with the requisite
means might make it in six months, there is in this country
no collection of books <span class='it'>relating to our own history</span> comparable
with several collections in England, and for works
by American authors, for our national literature, such as it
is, the very last place to look is in an American library.
Stepping a few days since into an extensive bibliographical
establishment in this city, we were shown an order for
American books, by catalogue, amounting to several thousand
dollars; with great difficulty they had been found
among the book-stalls and other out-of-the-way places,
and shipped to London, to be added to a collection probably
already as large as any existing here, except two or
three owned by governments and societies, and a few in the
hands of private individuals. We have examined carefully
most of the libraries of any consequence in the United
States, and know something of their condition. Small as
they are, compared with the libraries of Europe, they are
made up in a great degree of duplicate copies of worthless
books, and are most poorly supplied with works by our
countrymen or relating to our history and institutions.
They are managed by persons incompetent to discharge
their duties; have librarians who cannot comprehend the
title pages of half the books mentioned in their catalogues;
and add very little indeed to the means of obtaining knowledge
which have an independent existence. The Astor
library will be different. The large amount of money appropriated
by its founder, the ability of his actuary, and the
system which has been proposed for its government, give
promise that we are to have at length the <span class='it'>nucleus</span>, gradually
and surely to be enlarged into a really good American
library, to which scholars may resort with such hopes of
advantage as now prompt them to visit England, Germany,

subject, however ably or frequently it has been treated,
is not exhausted. Shakspeare’s works will probably continue
through all future time to be more read than any
other productions save the inspired books which compose
the Holy Bible. They contain peculiarities which distinguish
the author from every other writer, and have made
him for two centuries the object of the world’s attention
and admiration. With all the praise awarded to him by
the greatest critics of all nations, we believe with our correspondent
that he is not even yet generally understood,
and that many thousands read his plays, and see them performed,
without a true idea of their particular beauty and
profound meaning. The system of the German critic, Ulrici,
alluded to by Mr. Fay, is highly interesting, and this entire
series of papers—which will be completed in four or five

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
